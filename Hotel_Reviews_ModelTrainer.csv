Review,
 I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ,0
 Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge ,0
 My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep ,0
 You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again ,0
 Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars ,0
 Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it ,0
 Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good,0
 Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time,0
 The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night ,0
 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 ,0
 The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast ,0
 The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him ,0
 Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse,0
 We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment ,0
 We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely ,0
 Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit ,0
 Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery ,0
 Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner ,0
 The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv ,0
 Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you ,0
 We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom ,0
 There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical ,0
 Little bit on the pricey side,0
 Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective ,0
 Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums ,0
 Please see above,0
 The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two ,0
 Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality ,0
 not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation,0
 The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more ,0
 the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that,0
 Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet ,0
 Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy ,0
 Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate ,0
 Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again ,0
 Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that ,0
 The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning ,0
 Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either ,0
 The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else ,0
 The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups ,0
 Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here,0
 The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam ,0
 When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all ,0
 I loved everything ,0
 when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction,0
 there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night ,0
 Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task ,0
 The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference ,0
 The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management ,0
 The bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor ,0
 Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again ,0
 Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room ,0
 The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe ,0
 Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation ,0
 Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip ,0
 Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived ,0
 The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass ,0
 Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone ,0
 The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price ,0
 Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra ,0
 The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive ,0
 upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside ,0
 If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast ,0
 The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction ,0
 Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors ,0
 The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money ,0
 I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy ,0
 The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel ,0
 Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful ,0
 The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy ,0
 Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss,0
 That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel ,0
 Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait ,0
 No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up ,0
 We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain ,0
 Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done ,0
 The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere ,0
 In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair ,0
 There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas ,0
 The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate ,0
 Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout ,0
 Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend ,0
 split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing ,0
 Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud,0
 Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought,0
 There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant ,0
 it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot ,0
 Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle ,0
 Construction during the day though not intrusive,0
 The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined ,0
 No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance,0
 There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place ,0
 The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious ,0
 there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view,0
 Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant ,0
 We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel ,0
 I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20 ,0
 The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done ,0
 the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware ,0
 The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough ,0
 Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend ,0
 The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level ,0
 The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small ,0
 Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed,0
 The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central,0
 Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression ,0
 We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick ,0
 The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim ,0
 Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space,0
 There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night ,0
 It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished ,0
 First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all ,0
 the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor ,0
 The only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well ,0
 There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work ,0
 Building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming Gothic look of reception area Checking out at 11 30am Wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way See through glass to shower ,0
 We didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow ,0
 The fact I had to leave,0
 The d cor but hotel is currently being extended I expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished ,0
 The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating ,0
 Stairs in our room were too narrow and steep No where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road ,0
 We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel ,0
 The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper ,0
 The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning ,0
 More sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on ,0
 When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste ,0
 Room 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers Breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost ,0
 Could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night ,0
 The cleanness was quite poor A lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty Also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night ,0
 Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly ,0
 The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid ,0
 I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel,0
 the hotel was in a bad condition Not really clean and everything was worn out Breakfast was barely OK and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when I got it Hotel Arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise ,0
 Rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained ,0
 The hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms,0
 The room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which I thought was poor No bath in room even though I requested one on booking,0
 Radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem ,0
 Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired ,0
 Room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through ,0
 The hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking Building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive ,0
 The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money ,0
One Of The Receptionist she did a racist comment regarding My accent and my country The housekeeping Didnt like was a disaster Enter in The room Without knock The door a tall girl ,0
 Breakfast was crazy expensive Location required about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway Construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day ,0
 The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu ,0
 Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent ,0
 the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking,0
 The bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards ,0
 We didn t have a bad experience ,0
 Only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue,0
 Breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it ,0
 They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back,0
 When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts ,0
 Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting ,0
 The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom ,0
 The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp ,0
 The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion ,0
 Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool,0
 The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel ,0
 The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult ,0
 In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena,0
 Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only ,0
 Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful ,0
 Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the hotel,0
 No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine ,0
 the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants ,0
 The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel ,0
 Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing ,0
 Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please ,0
 Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive ,0
 The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times ,0
 At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked ,0
 Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc ,0
 The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future ,0
 Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had ,0
 next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay,0
 Building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at 6 30am ,0
 The room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs ,0
 The hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the hotel does need a facelift ,0
 Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all ,0
 No convenient stores surrounding hotel area Had to walk quite far for grocery shopping,0
 The pillow and the double charged city tax One of the staff at the reception is not so nice ,0
 We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice ,0
 Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done,0
 The rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it ,0
 Our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room 62 was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets ,0
 n a,0
 It s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre ,0
 No bad experiences,0
 floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet Black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate Hall way to rooms on 2nd floor was too dark gloomy Reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in I question the 4 star rating,0
 The bathroom needed to be deep cleaned Tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps Loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating,0
 There was a problem with the hairdryer in our room The hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror Just a minor detail really but a bit annoying ,0
 There were renovations going on that made it quite noisy at times,0
 The variety of the breakfast was not as good Empty marmalade coffee was more water ,0
 Small room in 2 levels connected by a very narrow and small steps The room in general shows a lack of maintenance walls courtains etc Very noisy room there where machines working just a few meters far from the window ,0
 Our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night ,0
 Rooms were not sufficiently cleaned on a daily basis i e no fresh cups provided once used toilet rolls not replaced bit embarrassing having to ask at reception for more ,0
 The only thing our room lacked was decent storage space but for a shorter stay 3 days this wasn t an issue ,0
 A bit noisy You can hear a lot through the walls It s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done ,0
 service of the breakfast team plates were not taken away had more eye to themselves entrance looked poor given the renovation of the other parts of the building ,0

 Room was pretty small for the three of us ,0
 Only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others 48 pounds plus tip ,0
 London hotel rooms are very small There was very little storage Would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage ,0
 The room for three people was on the small side ,0
 Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to ,0
 Our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet We had to require a different room at an extra cost of 30 a night ,0
 The cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good ,0
 The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv ,0
 Lower ground floor room L01 possibly the smallest bathroom I ve ever stayed in awful View from Windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside Won t go back ,0
 Dimensions of the room small But I m was a single room and Erls court London The space cost money as a traditional London hotel,0
 Squeaky floors Difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband Also 4th floor our window didn t open to the outside ,0
 Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves ,0
 The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company ,0
 The front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips Fortunately I could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions Additionally I was not entirely confident that they understood the questions I was asking in English ,0
 Staff not very friendly Did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed ,0
 Room size too small and it was too hot Our window was too small and It good lighting We stayed on the 4th floor and I believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window Breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there ,0
 The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold ,0
 The shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back ,0
 choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem ,0
 The fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential,0
 The rooms are very small we had trouble fitting 2 suitcases in The price is fairly high even by London s standards and breakfast was extra ,0
 The room is a little small and the decor is dated ,0
 Air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples ,0
 breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms ,0
 Breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great ,0
 Rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean ,0
 Bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in ,0
 The wifi is only 500kb s which isn t fast by today s standards The power socket near the bed was loosen I can t charge my phone ,0
 We were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room How ever it was clean and bed was comfortable ,0
 Wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using Chrome Breakfast coffee was only average,0
 We choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was 1 10 th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive The room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open ,0
 Not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular,0
 Top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in Rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures Shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath Lethal combination for the elderly or children Second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated Front desk staff very dismissive ,0
 The breakfast staff were not helpful When we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes to be seated They forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table After 25 minutes we were finally seated I was so upset I did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment We won t be back,0
 couldn t work out how to crank DOWN the heating in the room Bathroom is miniscule Mini bar was very limited with its choice,0
 Breakfast is expensive especially when I have already paid over 90 for a standard room per night ,0
 mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords Also It would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a 60 euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions When we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith ,0
 The only thing I can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal ,0
 I had to ask at breakfast all 3 mornings we were there for coffee and re fills I think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea,0
 My one complaint is the overly soft mattresses It was not good for my back ,0
 The mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft I had a neck ache the next morning The room was super tiny We stayed at the Hilton Bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison ,0
 Temperature in the room was difficult to regulate ,0
 I don t know if it was because I booked through Booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place Underground with no view Unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as I should have done it on check in I didn t know what I was going to be doing on check in Tea and biscuits not replenished the second day ,0
 Rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters Gym is open from 4 00 pm to 10 00pm when you usually are out ,0
 Soiled chair in room Pillows not clean Shower temp control very sensitive in 1st room we stayed in Value for money,0
 We asked for 2 singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation There were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work To be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so ,0
 Did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much Loo very low lucky I am only 5ft 2 ,0
 Staff not particularly helpful Have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this 3 times Breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a 4 Rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm,0
 Housekeeping missed my room one day and although I did not make much of a fuss over it I did not get a convincing explanation I did get an apology though ,0
 room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited,0
 bathroom is really small,0
 Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset ,0
 Weird atmosphere in reception many eastern European staff Room Cold and uninspiring 4 per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water Overpriced overall,0
 Front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission He tried to net an extra 40 on my bill with the horrible exchange rate When I caught it he told me I must have authorized it at check in which I had not Completely unacceptable ,0
 The towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting Also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations ,0
 The gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym ,0
 Two years in a row we checked in for 10 days On booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the 3pm check in time No effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room Last year our friends from the Midlands arrived for a 1 night stay while we were there and at 9am sharp their room was ready and they got in Let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night Who do you take care of ,0
 Saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening,0
 The air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc Our room on the 5th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about 3 m2 ,0
 The bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days I stayed for 6 nights The cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them They also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them,0
 It was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room 116 If it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy ,0
 The heating was not working in the room for the first two days,0
 I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer,0
 Noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional,0
 The room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight ,0
 I can t think of a thing that needed improved upon All aspects of my stay were excellent ,0
 Definitely not a 4 star hotel Triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling Not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable Facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion Except for the reception ladies staff very rude Definitely not reccomended Being in London in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars ,0
 Cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until 5pm For people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient ,0
 Very small room dated interior The cleaning could improve My room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed The bed was loosing boards underneath it ,0
 Maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help ,0
 There is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in October so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep Air con at this time of the year is opening the windows ,0
 We only stayed 2 nights ,0
 there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room 12 ,0
 The room was really really cold The heating didn t work I was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference This led to a really bad nights sleep ,0
 Thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy No scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs Should be constantly monitored This is a deceptively large and busy hotel I requested somewhere within close walking distance to Olympia 25 min walk is not that close ,0
 The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm,0
 Breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements Long periods without eggs etc Very limited selection of vegetables and salad Would probably expect better breakfast from a 4 star place ,0
 Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint ,0
 Personally I think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin ,0
 Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors ,0
 It took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again,0
 The breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning It would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining We would have been happy to pay for it too Instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day We noticed many guests doing the same ,0
 The official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like I did ,0
 The room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open It was very hot in London while I was there so it wasn t really under their control,0
 The ATM machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress ,0
 The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better ,0
 Air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night ,0
 Bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs ,0
 WiFi was a bit slow ,0
 Housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue ,0
 Ex Suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before The temperature of the room could not be lower than 18 degrees which wasn t cool enough ,0
 The bathroom is on the smaller side ,0
 the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold ,0
 Room was small but adequate There was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though I put some paper on it to indicate its existence Fire alarm went off at 2 am and we were all in the street for a while All was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation ,0
 Fire alarm and semi evacuation at 2 am little or no direction by staff Reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by Fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear No subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel Some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident ,0
 The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did ,0
 Room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central London Shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either ,0
 Our room had a very pungent smell of tobacco smoke The blackout blind didn t work very well ,0
 Air conditioning a little noisy we opened the window instead,0
 They weren t inexpensive ,0
 Farthest room from elevator Uncomfortable bed Air conditioning would not set to our temperature therefore far too hot in room Staff were not interested when told about it We did not sleep well because of it ,0
 Room needed to be redecorated as it was a little worn looking,0
 Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal ,0
 Room was really tiny and I don t think was good value for money but I would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel,0
 Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink ,0
 Small room Some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options ,0
 Wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive,0
 Not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired ,0
 Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way ,0
 Took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight Temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying ,0
 Not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid Aside from that the hotel was lovely ,0
 Its a hit and miss with the reception staff Sometimes I got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained The restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly ,0
 The double room we stopped in was a little small but was adequate ,0
 Occasional quirky sound from the floor next door or 1 floor above quite disturbing Expensive ,0
 the size of the room is small for Americans but pretty standard for Europe ,0
 The restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing,0
 I can t think of a single thing ,0
 Having stayed here a few times before I thought I would have a pleasant stay as usual I was wrong For a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way Those used to be good in this hotel Not when I visited this time I ll look for somewhere else for my next trip ,0
 The toilet was too low to the floor The room was much too hot and the Windows did not open ,0
 The toilet is slightly small though it contains everything The floor is wooden so you could hear people walking It will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep But for travellers just coming to London this does not count ,0
 The rooms were extremely small I don t think the breakfast was good value for money,0
 The room was too hot needed a fan over night to cool down no opening windows,0
 Wifi is hit and miss not a huge deal but it isn t great ,0
 Room very warm aircon was not cooling down the room Bathroom very small and toilet very low ,0
 No water to drink in spa area Room on small side compared to advertised twin room Kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in ,0
 Breakfast used to include a better selection ie smoked salmon more fruit selection champagne Now more English breakfast which means the cost is pricey at 15 pounds Wait staff not very friendly had to ask for coffee after they passed my table several times ,0
 The bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom There is a lack Of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless ,0
 Rooms are small and would have preferred one overlooking the garden instead we were over the front door and the flag pole was noisy ,0
 My room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling ,0
 the bathrooms ar very small BUT everything you need is there They were also spotless,0
 Serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems Please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies Now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always 100 coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time ,0
 Above Good location,0
 Bathroom a bit small,0
 Room a bit too small a bit too warm with no way to lower the heat the closet smells so i wasn t that happy to put my clothes in there ,0
 Breakfast was disappointing eggs were dry inside not cooked to order no hot dish for vegetarians,0
 things have changed slightly under new management no sparkling wine at breakfast cheese selection reduced no more nesepresso small changes but these were nice touches that are now lacking,0
 Breakfast was a little disorganised staff a little inattentive Decent selection however of food ,0
 Parking was handy and safe but quite expensive ,0
 Shower head a little unpredictable in terms of direction,0
 Cooked breakfast not very imaginative Too small plates Can t cook eggs Room not as big as I hoped for in exec room king size bed,0
 The room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season The hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing That is almost a fraud The breakfast is not nearly what it used to be It was okay but not a reason to come any more The location still is a reason ,0
 Room was too hot the windows do open but there were noisy revellers so we had to close the windows ,0
 the sofa in the room was quite uncomfortable leaving me with a aching back ,0
 The bathroom is quite small but did have a tub,0
 Wifi does not work in the room its a shame for a big business city like london in 2016 to dont provide proper wifi Had to work from the toilet where the signal was here,0
 The only bad thing I can tell about teh hotel is that the room was just a little bit small Not much space to move ,0
 Room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in London and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand The hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on Saturday Our room was not ready on time Having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one ,0
 Double glazing windows would have kept cold and noise outside But then this is a London old hotel ,0
 Insufficient UK power points for a couple on business without requesting UK adaptors Breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot Gym could do with an update Room was a little too compact ,0
 Dated rooms rooms stated bath and shower but did not have both a dated hotel on rooms but bar was trendy setting Reception staff do not care when you have booked as you are captive there ,0
 Very definitely the breakfast Fruit selection limited Very little input from staff Many 4 star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table The fried eggs were dry and inedible They clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished The outlook on to the garden was lovely ,0
 The room for 3 person are not very big And another very bad surprise is with Booking Hotel i Made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused,0
 Bathrrom quite cramped breakfast was ok but not outstanding more fruit ,0
 My only thing I would say was the food during the evening and this is only because the choices were very limited I am a fussy eater and couldn t see anything I liked however the breakfast was lovely,0
 The sauna facilities were located in the same room as the massage tables and exercise bikes a little compact and restrictive with no changing facilities ,0
 Thin wall can hear everything on the hallway I would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by ,0
 Worst nights sleep in a long long time Pillows were awful gave me a bad neck Couldn t turn the heating off I barely slept due to how hot it was Bathroom was absolutely stifling ,0
 First night s stay was very hot because air conditioning had been turned off throughout the hotel Requested a fan for our room but did not receive one ,0
 Front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us The scrambled eggs did not taste good at all Very buttery and watery ,0
 A little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in ,0
 Rooms to small smell coming from shower drain sugar not replenish after first night constant noise from other ac units by the time you got hot breakfast it was cold,0
 Room was too hot even with air con on full and heating right down ,0
 Bed in room 110 was appalling and needs replacement To compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means I was not the first to complain ,0
 old building re furnished sound travelled from top floor down bathroom very small,0
 very thin walls terrible nights sleep doors banging and water running no help with luggage offered dining room for breakfast far too warm for comfort reception staff in morning not offered to get taxi until i asked specifically to order write up on booking com implied 350 yards to Olympia it was not,0
 Bed is too hard pillows were horrible AC didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi Wouldn t recommend it at all,0
 The bathroom was far too small for an executive room The key of my room did not work properly ,0
 breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme ,0
 New management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its 9 rating for long,0
 Didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available We were lucky to have a space will book in future ,0
 Unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom The hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning I was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it ,0
 Lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise Window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open ,0
 The hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like IKEA The gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails,0
 The room was too hot despite the fact we turned down the thermostat ,0
 Rooms could have been a bit bigger Design and decor dated ,0
 Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable ,0
 a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light ,0
 This was my sixth visit in K K hotel George I brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast There was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy ,0
 The room was small and very warm even with air conditioning It was situated beside the lift even though I requested a quiet room The bathroom was even smaller ,0
 Room a little on the small side though perfect for one person Food in room service could have been a little more interesting Good coffee though ,0
 room was adjacent to staircase on 4th fnloor Sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast ,0
 Small rooms ,0
 English breakfast was not too good and a little cold However they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the English and there was plenty of choice ,0
 The room little bit small But for couple is enough in London you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok There is no air condition in the room or it was not working It was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in January ,0
 Bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for London hotels ,0
 I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home ,0
 Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better,0
 Prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again ,0
 The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price ,0
 Only one luft was in operation during peak season Single room was quite small Double rooms looked larger ,0
 See above tangent ,0
 I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again ,0
 We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor ,0
 Breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers,0
 in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources,0
 It was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride ,0
 1 Didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in 307 2 Had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited 15 minutes 3 Too warm ,0
 On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show ,0
 The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathroom was tiny ,0
 Room was small bathroom very small Breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning Coffee and tea not up to standard Breakfast buffet was good ,0
 Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained ,0
 Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall ,0
 Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London ,0
 The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant ,0
 One of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful ,0
 We had no ventilation in bathroom,0
 The beds Quite small room We asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room It was hidden in the cupboard ,0
 we had a bit of a hiccup the room we were given first as we opened the door the smell of smoke was very bad they moved us to a other room which was lovely,0
 Small rooms but very tidy Room insolation not perfect we could hear people from the room next to ours ,0
 Room and bathroom were far too hot even with both bedroom windows open it was too hot,0
 The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor ,0
 It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so,0
 No bad experiences at all,0
 Very expensive would not have stayed except meeting US family at same hotel I trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which I stood on as I got into bed Staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning Shows room had not been properly cleaned Unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair Room was tiny and not good value for money ,0
 Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent ,0

 Not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery Also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a 25 off voucher I would have been very annoyed if I had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal ,0
 No parking on site We parked about 1 2 mile away but it s expensive Parking from 15 30 Friday until 11 30am Sunday cost 42 00 Although reasonable by London standards it s an added expense for a weekend away Perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks Restaurant expensive given the quality of food ,0
 We have been charged for room service that we did not have I spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of 43 53 issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed This has not been done ,0
 It would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station Customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel ,0
 Every thing was excellent Apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at 9 am by staff walking in room When I mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered ,0
 No problems at all ,0
 Not a lot to put in this section If I was going to be very picky I d say the food menu was average but still very palatable i e not bad Wine list could be improved ,0
 Meals very plain No extras or garnishes Restaurant staff didn t seem very knowledgeable Cold croissants for breakfast ,0
 No toothbrush provided,0
 The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while ,0
 The Wi Fi was rather terrible My husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine And since I did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip I was relying on Wi Fi to communicate while in London Thankfully there were other locations around the city where I could connect to the Wi Fi ,0
 The only thing I d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows ,0
 They don t have parking and there is no easy parking available nearby ,0
 The staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation The view from the hotel was quite uninspiring ,0
 More seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets ,0
 The cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal We were checking out that day so no need to clean the room Being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft ,0
 This was my second time at this hotel the first time I booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room I was given This time I opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room I had stayed in before It just might be that I was given a free upgrade the first time ,0
 Going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings They were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building,0
 Some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too ,0
 A few more little milks maybe as I drink a lot of tea but I was given a little jug of milk when I asked ,0
 The air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive A lot better value for money in other hotels ,0
 The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better ,0
 If we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different Literally could not find fault with anything ,0
 Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction ,0
 At the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel ,0
 We felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another 100 to price of our stay ,0
 The room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive But understand I wasn t paying for a view ,0
 Bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them ,0
 Not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago Although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show Carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not EU compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little Bose speaker have the old iPhone 4 connector ,0
 Breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on Fleet Street ,0
 Service Also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you Had my 60th birthday while staying The hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits Spent two thousand pounds on 3 rooms Felt short changed ,0
 My son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms He booked directly with Apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that I paid Booking via booking com cost me almost an extra 50 for breakfasts even after I had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison ,0
 Everything was genuinely perfect ,0
 Bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iPhone 4 adapter Advertised sky movies but was pin protected but I m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code ,0
 It took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room ,0
 The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this ,0
 Service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast ,0
 A couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans ,0
 Room on small side for a King very expensive for the Wednesday Thursday nights First night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab Third night managed to find 2 soft pillows Bed comfortable Not enough hangers in cupboards for 2 people staying more than 1 night Room temperature control did not go lower than 19C and seemed to revert to 25C once room key taken out Bar prices on the high side ,0
 Lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled Jellybeans and Pringles missing Only one duck 2people Automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users Didn t get the room I booked ,0
 The ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but I am aware I m fussy with my baths ,0
 A bit mean with tea coffee milk in room ,0
 Tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay ,0
 We got a room 542 with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony Especially in summer you won t have much privacy Location Temple is very central but still I would chose another central location the next time I m in London as in the weekends Temple seems a bit deserted ,0
 1 The hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that I can understand But then the plug in the room should be closer to the Mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord Because I could not see myself in the Mirror whilst I was drying my hair So basically the hotel has have 3 options Larger hair dryer electric cord Electric plug closer to the mirror Mirror on both sides of the TV 2 Another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night I guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced ,0
 Can t think of anything that could have been improved ,0
 The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating Pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go ,0
 Sorry can t think of any negative thing ,0
 How hasn t this place got a extra star It should be five star not four ,0
 The basin doesn t seem to be clean enough It s difficult to drain waters down the basin,0
 The shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty ,0
 Could have had a few more different tea bags in room ,0
 As always the price of breakfast is far too expensive There are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices ,0
 We heard our neighbors bathroom in the night,0
 Just loved it ,0
 IN the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk I didn t know what happened The air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature ,0
 Hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help ,0
 All is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower Likewise bedroom was not clean ,0
 We didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away ,0
 There wasn t a full length mirror in the room We were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup ,0
 Unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for 1 2 hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available I did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free ,0
 Wardrobe was not so big but ours room had a nice sofa zone that we use to leave stuff so in the end was all ok,0
 I realise that good accommodation is expensive in central London but neverthelessI feel this hotel is somewhat costly We were on a room only rate so I cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel ,0
 Just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day Maybe need to book very early to get a good deal ,0
 We didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered Service was very slow one hour and a Half for 1 burger 1 risotto and 2 pies ,0
 I can t think of anything that could have been improved ,0
 All minor issues The location of the room was good however I did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room When we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal There was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing Also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time One opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping ,0
 The food we ordered in the hotel restaurant wasn t available We had to venture out to eat instead ,0
 Several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips ,0
 The Smart TV wasn t connected to the Internet So I couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart TV Also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else ,0
 really couldn t fault it ,0
 We brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated ,0
 Room smelt a little smokey and the towels didn t smell fresh slightly musty My in room breakfast pancakes went so hard I couldn t cut them which makes me think they were zapped to make them hot ,0
 Was not told about the 30 extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days This needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive ,0
 While some staff were outstanding and performed very well e g Jesus Other staff were just rude to the level that I will not recommend this hotel to any of my network ,0
 We chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and London has so much more to offer when it comes to food Pillows were too chunky,0
 All good ,0
 I didn t understand the continental breakfast setup My room didn t include breakfast A weetabix and pastry and tea ended up costing 18 pounds ,0
 No full length mirror in bedrooms Breafast quality could have been better servuce was lacking,0
 Being really really picky here more space on desk to lay out cosmetics to sit and do make up in comfort rather than using bathroom mirror ,0
 Room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to 19 degrees ,0
 I bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the 8 service charge They were not happy when I queried it and asked for the money back Light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced,0
 Maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them ,0
 In an ideal world the hotel would be a bit closer to the tube station although it was only a 10 minute walk away ,0
 We were put in a disabled room so no bath ,0
 Check in lady was quite abrupt and that s the first impression spoiled instantly Double room was booked via this site and but got told on arrival not advised that there are no double beds available and I will have to have room with two singles Disappointment number two and hope for comfy sleep gone AC unit in the room was making very loud clicking noise faulty stat occasionally Bose docking station only suitable for iPhone 4 do those still exist There was a sign about the bath mat in the bathroom but no bath mat At this price range it was somewhat disappointing experience ,0
 My room was opposite the lifts and was quite noisy which wasn t ideal when trying to work Would have been good if there was a sliding door in between the entry area and bedroom so it could be closed to minimise outside sounds ,0
 the heating was turned to 25 degrees in the room when we checked in so it was a bit warm ,0
 there was no bubble bath,0
 Room facing a wall ,0
 I was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description The view offices 5 meter from my window The price of room service,0
 Need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but I find that problem during most of my stays in hotels The room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner I DIDN T make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned ,0
 Was difficult to see from afar where hotel is Had to literally be up close to realise yoi were at the right place ,0
 In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault ,0
 room isn t as photo shows in booking We booked superior king room with balcony descprtion photo shows room size 30m2 with sofa We were given a room on 4 floor the room was small abt 20 23m2 only one bed with little standing space beside bed no sofa balcony not like photo shown Where u can have dinner there this balcony only had standing space ,0
 One staff member on reception was a bit trite when queried why photo ID was required for a second time after checking in earlier in the day ,0
 The AC couldn t keep the room cool during the day even with the shades down About 1 3 of the TV channels didn t work due to weak signal Only one elevator bank for guests it s a walk from the higher number rooms There are other lifts but they re staff only ,0
 There really wasn t anything to dislike about this hotel ,0
 Regular customer of Apex City of London hotel They didn t know I was a returning customer upon arrival Breakfast should have been included for over 300 for a room ,0
 The room that I was given is smaller than what was shown when I reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one The room view was to corporate offices so I couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode ,0
 The room was warm overnight despite the aircon being set to the lowest possible temperature ,0
 The restaurant was not big enough to cope with demand so we had to wait for a table to become free,0
 Staff wasn t super friendly Doorman was impatient and bordering on rude ,0
 No decaff tea bags and only one packet of biscuits in the room ,0
 Seemed very matter of fact at Reception Lacked warmth Didn t like smokers on balcony next to mine ,0
 Location was ok but a lot of places were shut at weekend so there wasn t too much right on the doorstep ,0
 Oddly I was placed in a disabled room but not a problem and nice to see that they have great facilities for those who may be less mobile ,0
 We had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit ,0
 The noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed,0
 Breakfast was chaotic Slow and had to keep on asking for missing items Definitely the B team on that day Was better in previous stay ,0
 The really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening ,0
 Booked a room for 3 and were told it would be a sofa bed Didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable No sleep in preparation for a long drive home Also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up A bit disappointing after a long day ,0
 Enjoyed it all ,0
 Only 1 small bottle of water left per day and our room never had the complimentary snacks Pringles and jelly beans during our 4 night stay ,0
 When we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one Actually this was not a problem I prefer to have more empty space Also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since I am travelling very often to London it will be a problem for me during winter months ,0
 None,0
 Staff in reception not helpful nore friendly Besides we had to wait 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar the waiter never came we had to go to the bar Poor service compared to the hotel ranking,0
 We chose this expensive hotel because the photos on Booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over London and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal When we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same The restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor The photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food We were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading ,0
 The coffee was a bit weak but this is a small shortcoming in context ,0
 Staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception I also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room I spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number Once I called reception they said they would called in house service but I still didn t receive the cup Perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty P Also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work Not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance In summary great stay and I would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way ,0
 area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only 10 15 mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception ,0
 Located in the business district thus a fair distance walk from most attractions and restaurants Limited view,0
 Can t think of anything we were so pleased with everything,0
 Very poor front desk service the morning we left We did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport I attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to Heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in London We ended up with a taxi that took 1 5 hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about 125 If you re not from London be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district Many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on Saturday We walked to Covent Garden for pretty much everything ,0
 Can t find fault with anything loved it ,0
 Room was not ready for us to check in The front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal No sense of personal individualised service ,0
 Access to the bar was difficult as there were some corporate events Understandable considering the quality of the hotel so not really a low point just a minor inconvenience,0
 Accessibility is terrible in the hotel we have a baby buggy and it was nightmare for us to enter and exit from hotel no ramps lots of steps hotel is very big and room corridors are like a maze there is only one lift the other one next to it is broken and not fixed in 6 days on the hotel you have go long way on maze like corridors front desk was also very rude on check in I had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not helpful and acted very rude,0
 Housekeeping didn t wash used cups didn t change duvet cover was clean on arrival dropped spoon and made a coffee stain ,0
 Milk had gone off in room facility plus only one packet of biscuits between us Staff seemed unable to activate second keycard for room and only one pair of complementary slippers instead of two Not enough vegetarian options on the restaurant menu ,0
 As above,0
 Two adjacent rooms were requested Upon arrival only one was ready ,0
 Room looked over by office block Strong smell of cleaning fluid in the room Staff gave us another room without hesitation,0
 Location for me but it is still very central ,0
 A bit mean with tea coffee milk etc The only outside seating area was very busy we couldn t get a table in the evening ,0
 Bar and food prices but then it is London and the whole City is a rip off ,0
 It would be nice if the waiter who brings the breakfast to the room was as friendly as all the other staff ,0
 The lighting was pretty dark Room lighting would go a long way instead of a lamp ,0
 Entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps As it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps ,0
 They gave me the barrier free room which was not as comfortable as expected View on a wracked street corner so I felt a bit disappointed in view of the rather high price ,0
 Details of the restaurant menus in the room might have encouraged us to use these as it was we ate out ,0
 Skimpy with the tea biscuits coffee tray No opening window Bit pricey compared with other similar London stays ,0
 We had to change rooms which was easily done and quickly without a hassle because the air conditioning was not working ,0
 Cannot think of anything,0
 My self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration On arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this She then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports She then asked how long we have been in the country Very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend We have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review REGARDS MR SURJ DHAMI ,0
 The place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort By the end of the trip I found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful The room was ridiculously dark It was a big room but with one small window For that reason alone I would never stay there again The air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference Almost every night I was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed The staff did not say hello to me once and I was there for five nights The cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility But it was then suggested to me that I had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue Not to be repeated ,0
 Kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry Try Loch Fyne kippers Best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard ,0
 Only tiny issue the internet was slow and the firewall prevented me from remote access to my server which was based in London not that far away so that was a major inconvenience as on my last day I had to work ,0
 Bar prices but that s London for you ,0
 Can t really think of anything,0
 For 3 days straight I found the staff dumped my cloths on the floor luckily with the cloth clean bag The room cleaning did not reach the standard level of services ,0
 Laundry dry cleaning rates Whilst service and product is excellent the cost seems much too high ,0
 The breakfast and drinks at the bar were quite expensive we went to a place around the corner and got breakfast for 2 people for under the cost of 1 person at the hotel,0
 Too little wardrobe space No chest of drawers in the room only two very small drawers Lighting in the bathroom could have been better No where to put toiletries in the shower,0
 Expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage,0
 Did not have enough time to appreciate all of the hotel facilities ,0
 No FOX news or CNBC on TV these are important channels for US visitors Big selection of international channels from other countries Wish there was ice machine on floor for convenience,0
 There was a bit of a wait for some at breakfast This is being super picky though as genuinely hard to find any fault at all ,0
 The breakfast was expensive but we wanted to explore and so brunched out while we were there ,0
 I sleep warm and I couldn t get the room cool enough but that s minor ,0
 All good ,0
 There wasn t anything we didn t like ,0
 I stayed on a Sunday night and paid a very good rate for this quality of hotel but expensive during the week ,0
 I couldn t fault it at all,0
 The ONLY down point I have on the hotel is the heat in the room at times was very very high I understand the weekend we visited London was very warm but the air con could be reviewed to allow lower temperatures ,0
 I found the breakfast a bit too expensive but the service was great ,0
 Limited views but not an issue for us as it s not located for that and we were out most of the day and evening ,0
 Breakfast was very expensive,0
 Am struggling to think of any negatives In fact I cannot think of any at all ,0
 Bar prices a little steep ,0
 Breakfast prices might be reduced,0
 When staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the Club Lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade I thought this was a bit mean spirited Also we were awoken at 8 20am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them,0
 None,0
 The wash basin in our bathroom was obviously partially blocked and took several minutes to drain It wasn t a major problem and we reported it on departure Whilst the restaurant was fine for breakfast it looked rather boring for dinner so we ate out every night ,0
 Wifi was weak needed a comfy chair in the bedroom needed adjustable lighting so you don t disturb each other room looked out onto walls windows of other rooms dark and no view at all ,0
 No complaints,0
 bed could be a little softer possibly with a topper ,0
 Was approx 10 minute walk to closest tube station because its equally distanced between Temple and Black Friars stations Could just be me being lazy though ,0
 view the views featured in the glossy information where not visible from our rooms One had an ok view of the courtyard area but he other was the view of an unfished building project not much else ,0
 N A,0
 Over priced it is a nice hotel but facilities and offering is not validating price charged This time I was lucky and get very good offer on the price via booking com I will be coming back every time when I m able to secure such price Breakfast is disappointing ,0
 Booked without breakfast but decided in the evening to opt for breakfast Were told when we booked in we could pre order any time but when we went to the desk in the evening we were told we should have ordered it when we booked in and that it was too late now to get the special offer so we ended up having to pay the full price Conflicting information from the staff ,0
 Food drink was delicious but a little pricey,0
 The breakfast is expensive ,0
 Room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con Wifi is not super speed as stated in fact I couldn t log on at all for our two night stay ,0
 An extra 30 charge I m still to work out for what The additonal 30 Wasn t on my receipt at checkout Would be very disappointed to learn an additonal charge had been added for the 10 mins or so we went into the club lounge upon checkout Especially when we thought it was very hospitable of them to let us gather our thoughts as we were rushing at checkout ,0
 My one experience in the dining room was not great I ordered a cheese omelette server brought ham omelette horrifying this vegetarian ,0
 All night menu could have had better quality choices ,0
 Would have liked an Easter Duck to go with our christmas duck Parking is quite a distance from the hotel However very good rate Would be nice to have the option of valet parking ,0
 Breakfast was great but wasn t buffet style which I prefer but that s the only minimal thing I could think of everything else was amazing and would recommend this highly,0
 Breakfast staff were aloof and unhelpful ,0
 The only thing for us was the location as we are not familiar with London We found it quite difficult to find Other than that we couldn t have asked for anything better ,0
 Room backed into another building and thoroughfare Lack of privacy so had to keep the curtain closed,0
 elephant wonderful but the cow is not needed ,0
 The bin men came a little later on a Sunday morning but hey we were in central London its noisier in 5 hotels Certainly not the hotels fault ,0
 24 hour bar service would be good but I can t really fault anything we had a brilliant stay ,0
 It would be nice if it was a bit cheaper ,0
 There is a definite problem with the smoking ban for those who smoke one has to walk all the way through those corridors to smoke outside There has to be a better option available either a special smoking area inside the hotel or the availability of rooms for smokers ,0
 Room not set up well for using mirror at desk for make up hair as poorly lit and too far from sockets to use blow dryer provided in room Since staying over for a night out with friends these little things would have been nice ,0
 Did not take breakfast but expensive,0
 Too hot everywhere Air conditioning system in the bedroom was difficult to manage tried to set it at 19 degrees but it seemed to jump back to 24 ,0
 Breakfast too expensive so ate elsewhere ,0
 too expensive for me most of the time ,0
 Receptionist stand offish and rude on arrival however I would visit again the positives by far outweigh the negatives ,0
 Tea and Coffee facilities were good but not excellent These places never leave enough milk in the rooms This is the worst thing I can say about the hotel and it s not even that bad ,0
 Would be nice to have a pool and spa facilities and no views,0
 Wish we could have stayed longer Shame the room didn t have a view but didn t matter for one night ,0
 I would of loved to of stayed another night or two ,0
 We had late night drinks and noticed all others had complimentary nibbles We didn t get any and over 10 for 2 beers it would have been appreciated ,0
 There was no table and chairs on the balcony and only 1 plastic chair in the corner of balcony In a double room you d expect there to be 2,0
 Not sure bar a little expensive compared to other similar venues ,0
 Only a one night stay ,0
 The room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character It felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure It was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities The view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall It made the room very dark However not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable In this instance I was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff ,0
 The maid coming into my room on both mornings at 0930 when mentioned to desk on checking out it was meet with minimal empathy,0
 Room was directly opposite an office that could see in our room ,0
 Breakfast overcooked expensive and tried to add service charge removed when I complained Not easy to get to by tube ,0
 Pillows to soft and room service to keen Woke us up by barging into our room twice in the morning ,0
 the water boiler for preparing the tea was in a cabinet When we moved on the table to prepare the tea outside the cabinet the fire alarm went on The personnel recommended us to always boil the water in the cabinet ,0
 We paid extra to use the club lounge but they didn t provide spirits which was disappointing as you have to drink a lot of beer and wine to justify 25 It was the only bar part of the break ,0
 The executive lounge was a let down and I would not pay the extra to access this facility again ,0
 The only thing was that I had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with 2 candles a 3 and a 0 and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel I was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles A bit dissapointed there cause I would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise ,0
 They forgot to service room and had to be called late afternoon Even then they failed to clear a drinks tray,0
 The Club lounge was good for breakfast however not up to much for the remainder of the day no spirits Canap s or snacks only beer and mixers and water,0
 I still found the hotel a little on the expensive side Also not a big thing but if you re going to have a Bose sound dock in the room there s no point in it only being compatible with outmoded iPods iPhones ,0
 Expensive breakfast price ,0
 Bathroom too cold and not heated Towel bar heated but only when room key is inserted Also a little surprised by the Club Room no snacking possibilities No English beer ,0
 The price is steep It is quite luxurious but maybe not 200 a night luxurious ,0
 Not a single thing ,0
 Breakfast was quite expensive and wasn t included in the room price They also added 12 5 service charge which for a self serve buffet seemed excessive although good choice of food and tasty,0
 There wasn t any information prior to dining to inform us only the New Year s Eve dinner menu was available However our request was promptly dealt with and we were able to choose from the a la carte menu ,0
 Children in the club lounge however hotel adjusted bill when commented on,0
 Service is really poor in this hotel Very expensive for low value services For same price you can find something better in the same location There is a bar in the main lobby the team is inefficient and not friendly at all ,0
 I know this is London and an extremely nice hotel but it is very expensive ,0
 The bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks One of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental A poor experience compared to the Hilton or other equivalent lounges I wouldn t have minded that much but I purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access ,0
 Rude reception staff at check in Rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for 45 mins then when we enquirer where our other 2 rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was great,0
 We were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half 2 by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until 6 o clock However being the weekend before Christmas I can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be ,0
 There was a big problem the staff apologized and I was to have received a refund of some money but I never did aThe issue was stressful I would not return,0
 The standard room was small perhaps one of the more expensive ones would have been better You literally could just walk around the edge of the bed Breakfast was very expensive We didn t bother just 5 minutes walk along the road was Pret where the price was a quarter as much ,0
 It s not really a bad experience but I did find a pair of socks from the previous guests in the corner of the bedroom There was also an awareness of noise when the outside door was opened and closed so I would request a different room next time ,0
 Dinner in restaurant was okay but little too expensive also breakfast was quite expensive many caf s around can t recommend Garfunkels near St Pauls quite far from underground if carrying a suitcase but bus stop in front,0
 Ok not major moans but Far too hot in main areas halls but room has thermostat to cool it down Restaurant wasn t good just about ok Food a little cold and too pricey for what is was ,0
 Breakfast was a little over priced but we did get a 25 discount ,0
 Expensive but this caliber of hotel in this location are all very expensive and relatively speaking this venue provides good value ,0
 We paid 39 for the day for car parking but when we asked the concierge we were told that the hotel had discount parking 3 mins away Why don t they advertise this A van parked outside outside our bedroom and left the engine running which was bad ,0
 We couldn t check in with two attempts even at 2 45pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone 9pm Although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully ,0
 Parking there isnt any the parking is about half a mile away The hotel could do with valet parking services ,0
 The walk from the nearest underground It s not really that far but I m pregnant so I struggled a little bit,0
 I just don t think a room without breakfast is worth 269 I suppose the problem is that if people will pay it you can charge it ,0
 Bathroom smelled soooo bad Like a dead rat un the pipes And at 9h in the morning cleaning lady entered the room while I was still asleep what the hell ,0
 Breakfast is quite pricey but lovely,0
 Breakfast in the morning is not very well organized Could wait more than 30 min before getting your english breakfast,0
 We found the mattress a bit stiff have doubled the topper that helped Minor points Only one hook in bathroom we needed more Lights in cupboard fine but why no lights in tea coffee cupboard We could hardly see what we were doing with the hot water ,0
 The only drawback no parking But there is a public car park 15 minutes walk from the hotel In the preliminary correspondence with the hotel we received very polite and detailed instructions on how to find parking Special thanks to the staff for it ,0
 Hotel clearly had issues at breakfast and couldn t cope at busy times with several guests waiting 45 mins for their cooked breakfast However hotel didn t charge and sent a quick email apologising,0
 As in most hotels it is hard to see adequately in the mirrors to put on make up or for my husband to shave A very common fault ,0
 Only one european style 220 Volt electricity plug however Adapter would have been available ,0
 Expensive glass wine but you pay for the location Not a problem,0
 Slightly further away from tube stations but good bus links and ttaxis,0
 Very few cons Entry from street was how we entered initially Not best with luggage Rear court entry hard to find was better Some cabs knew some did not Also lack of hooks in entry or bath made for sleek look at some loss of function ,0
 Breakfast is very expensive 21 12 5 even if compared to hotels like the Househorse Guards where it costs some 18 for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service It s better to go to Balthazar or even a Starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get ,0
 The bed wasn t the most comfortable and the room was fairly small for the price we paid ,0
 Breakfast in bed was expensive and was almost cold by the time we ate They forgot the orange juice ,0
 A computer glitch caused double holds to be placed on my credit card for my stay However the staff responded quickly to attempt resolution of the issue ,0
 The pillows are super thick so if you prefer thin pack your own ,0
 The restaurant and bar are expensive Not much to do in the immediate area at the weekend but the West End and Thames are just a short walk away,0
 The grubsrew that secures the tap faucet to the Tap mixer unit was missing and was only discovered to be missing when the tap was used and water pressure then pushed the faucet off the mixer tap base this was reported to reception on Sat Sun and Monday morning still no fix before check out amusing the first time you flood the bathroom and take a cold shower More amusing when the second time it is not you who gets wet Definitely not amusing when it happens a third time because maintenance cannot fix the faucet only push it back on ,0
 Only minor thing was room wasn t ready 2 hours after we could have checked in We then waited another hour with a complimentary drink it didn t detract from our stay but if we had waited 3 hours it would have time from check in to room ready ,0
 The only issue we had was finding the hotel via our taxi drivers Do a little research on the location beforehand to help your taxi driver out ,0
 Menu breakfast not included and expensive visit to Gafunkals Cafe 2 min walk was a great alternative ,0
 The only tiny issue I have is that there is no green tea available in the room without having to call room service ,0
 No milk for tea making but it didn t really interfere with the great stay we had ,0
 I wish we could have stayed longer ,0
 Ridiculous service charge at bar even though you go to bar and get your own drinks and take them to your own table Reason being that waitress did not understand order for bottle of wine even pointing it out on menu ,0
 Expensive Restaurant lacked any character,0
 Breakfast was decidedly mediocre given how excellent everything else was Certainly wouldn t pay extra for this next time ,0
 The room on the first day was a mile away from the lifts however on the second day another room was found where we did not have to walk so far ,0
 Breakfast could have been better organised with a few extra staff although the hotel appeared to be fully booked and therefore was very busy A few items were unavailable on Sunday due to shortages The breakfast itself was great and the staff impeccable ,0
 I believe daily rate differentials should be advised to customers not after the fact,0
 I cannot think of anything ,0

 Rented junior suite Bedroom area had no windows,0
 The first night we were given an extremely small room with the bathroom door broken Next morning when we made a complaint they gave us a perfect room ,0
 They stolen 800 from my money from the safe box at my room I couldn t report to police because shortage of time to reach my flight back They can watch the cameras and identify easily the staff who entered my room and return back my money ,0
 The room was appalling I had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and I understand that may not always be possible In saying that they gave me a room in the basement Supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what I had originally booked Which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small There was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work There was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort There was not much room to hang clothes or put things away There was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for 2 I will not be staying here again ,0
 The change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so I have reviewed some of gust comments before and I faced the same If you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which I will not recommend So the only room fit 3 adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult The room pic dose not match the reality ,0
 Our room seemed hidden away in the bowels of the hotel It did have a large frosted window but when examined it clearly looked out on to a manky neglected ourdoor light shaft ,0
 Noisy air con ,0
 Our first room had water leaking from the ceiling room above dripping down into our room We had to change rooms and the staff refused to give a monetary refund discount for the inconvenience I asked to speak with the manager about my disatisfaction and for 7 days was put off Additionally the ac was very loud did not work well and I was always hot The junior suite was too small for 3 people The sheets were not changed for 7 days Choose a different hotel ,0
 Very small rooms Bed was uncomfortable Shower flooded the bathroom No bath Carpet and mattress were stained Expensive compared to other hotels we could have booked in the area that would have offered the same standard ,0
 The photos of the compact room do it show how small it really is This room will only just have enough room for you luggage ,0
 It s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault Checking in was very chaotic it was very busy Some people had been double booked Also when we went to check in at 2 15pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which I didn t think was a very good excuse The hotel was OK but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for ,0
 Run down needs new furniture and painting Not clean enough and when cleaner comes with just polish and a rag then you know it s not being cleaned good enough ,0
 More tea bags and milk for making your own drinks would be good ,0
 Rooms were not very well maintained Not clean at all To be honest we were expecting better in the money we spent I will never stay in this hotel again ,0
 The A C control in the room did not work We notified the issue the day we checked in but it was never fixed We needed to call the counter for them to change the room temperature The furnishings in the lobby need attention they look old and beat ,0
 Room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space I feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help Not good if you are claustrophobic Also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows Bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower Anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there I would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a 7 10 minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate ,0
 We couldn t see out of our window there wasn t much of a view ,0
 Wifi is slow as it seems to be in most London hotels breakfast is buffet no a la carte available,0
 The room was very small and at the back of the hotel off the main corridor we checked in late in the evening and I felt we got the small room at the back cause we were late arriving ,0
 Tiny rooms v small shower cramped space for suitcase,0
 More space Just my wife and I packed in room On website rooms appeared much more spacious Staff was nice but very difficult to communicate with ,0
 Tricky to find as there are two similar named hotels in same area ,0
 The restaurant is quite cramped and seemed to be a bit chaotic at breakfast I waited a long time for my pot of tea Then when I asked when it was coming I was given someone else s pot of tea whom had also been waiting for a long time ,0
 Underfloor heating in bathroom was on even though there was a heat wave ,0
 The mattress was a little crunchy ,0
 Rooms are a bit small with not much space to store clothes But the beds are big ,0
 This is a noisy overpriced hotel When I arrived they put me in a ground floor room next to the road really right next to it When I tried to go to sleep all I could hear were people outside and the television upstairs I requested a move and was given a new room Some where in the room was a boiler unit in the wall that would turn on every now and then and sound like a small jet engine In the morning I could here the person above me taking a shower and flushing the toilet ,0
 Although it wasn t an issue for me as it wasn t vital there was no instruction to operate the TV and the provided Handy device ,0
 Very tiny space no room to walk at all Shower is super small I am tiny myself but I didn t have room to turn around ,0
 The loo hadn t been cleaned and had been well used ,0
 The room was a bit small but still very good for London standards I was at first disappointed that there was no proper shower it was the floor of the toilet bathroom which you don t expect from such a hotel but in the end it was ok and the water had good pressure ,0
 The design of the toilet bath area will get the whole floor to be wet Would be better if there is a segregation The tap of the basin seems to be old and it was very tight ,0
 Room was advertised as twin bed but was only 1 bed Not very appropriate as I was travelling with my mother 75yrs and had to share it No reception for my phone in the room,0
 N A,0
 we could not close the door to the main room door without having to lift our bed up and the bathroom was just a wet room that was so small it made the whole bathroom wet stright away,0
 The staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay I arrived 4 hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a 30 hour journey from Australia I didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until 2 hours after their advertised check in time I was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags The toilet floor was covered in urine It was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel ,0
 There was water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom in the morning which I thought was odd There was also no plug near a mirror to do my hair ,0
 Seat cover in dining room badly ripped which detracted from the ambience a little ,0
 Very restricted in bathroom too small and did not like the overhead shower ,0
 First night I was put in a basement room with no signal not ideal when you re trying to work in the evening They moved me for the 2nd night and the TV didn t work for the majority of the evening ,0
 Shower screen could have been a little wider so less water splash but we sorted it very quickly as it was ,0
 Bathroom needed a bit of renovation,0
 The bed was very uncomfortable and too small The room was smaller than expected and it was a luxury room ,0
 I did not stay long enough to spot any flaws I thoroughly enjoyed the experience ,0
 I stayed for 5 days in the hotel First of all the room was very small and not like in the picture very small Then the A C controller was not working in the room so each time I had to call the reception to change the temperature of the room And the door of my room was in the front of the lift and because it is very old lift there was noise from the lift They told me they will change the room but they didn t ,0
 Room very small and air con didn t work but biggest problem was the position of the toilet as the wet room shower glass door was way too close to front of toilet so had to sit sideways and even then easy to hit your head when sitting standing,0
 Our room was very small and in a basement That I did not expect The was no space to unpack things from suitcase Not much daylight no view ,0
 Room was tight bed was so close to wall you could not walk around it Made getting into bed a challenge for one partner ,0
 For the hold on my credit card they took a physical impression on carbon paper Can t prove this is related but that same evening I had a fraudulent charge on my card for 0 99 on iTunes The hotel was great but I don t think I will allow anyone to take an impression of my card again ,0
 No fridge and only plug sockets were far away other than that the room was faultless ,0
 Booked a Club room when we arrived the room was under the Main Street and didn t even have any windows Hardly 4 Star and what you expect from a Club Room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary Dressing Gowns 2 Bottles of Wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a Club Room Also when going to shower ready for the theatre at 1600 there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower The Club Room Bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label Club Lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room Tottlag a waste of good money spent ,0
 The hotel is fine and well run but the rooms are small But that is the luck of the draw ,0
 paying at arrival cause when something goes wrong like there was no hot water next morning you cant just move somewhere else quickly ,0
 There was no hot water the day we checked out ended up travelling without a proper bath shave and while checking out not a word of apology either,0
 Having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised,0
 Our room was far too small and with hindsight we should have asked to be moved One had to negotiate around the bed with hardly any wardrobe space and certainly nowhere one would want to sit comfortably ,0
 I didn t like the restaurant which was effectively the bar There was a single member of staff who had to do everything run the bar take food orders clear tables and take payments The food was just ok It wasn t a great experience ,0
 Shabby room facilities Poor wifi Poor TV options terrible interface and charging for movies Poor shower no screen no hands free attachment to wall bits falling off not very nice shampoo shower gel Long hallways with sloping floors Not very clever use of space awkward placement of wardrobe and desk May have been fine 10 years ago but not when compared to modern hotels who offer much more comfort for less or equal price ,0
 The rooms were well appointed however somewhat small for two friends Perhaps with a partner they would have been alright We stayed in a Club room ,0
 You can smell food being cooked in the morning although we were at the first floor Rooms are not quiet too noisy You can hear your neighbors They do not provide complimentary water ,0
 The room was too hot and noisy We could not get the temperature down The carpets in the corridors were old giving a bad first impression The shower very small not normal for this price The bar was more like a waiting room ,0
 Not electricity in room after card was put into place Fortunately arrived late and left early but struggled the next day to get to work with low battery life ,0
 they dont have separate bed base for twin room but mattress are separate shower is small and i can hear upper room shower,0
 Don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms Booked a Double Delux Room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a Compact Double Room though reception confirmed we had a Delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a Compact Double Room that is what we had Very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for 2 shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase Bathroom was a wet room Did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by ,0
 I could not easily control the temperature in the room Instructions on the wall would help ,0
 The shower had limescale on the floor the bed was dirty initially and room furniture was a little tattered but was all rectified when I was moved rooms twice,0
 Reading lights over the bed should be individual Impossible for one person to read without lighting up the whole room Safe difficult to set and in strange position Hairdryer difficult to use because of position inside a wardrobe ,0
 Avoid basement rooms No windows We had for one night and staff offered us room change to upper floors for remaining three days when we requested ,0
 Accommodation did not match website images Not value for money Unwillingness to allow us to relocate,0
 I asked the reception to book a taxi for me to the airport but at the time that the car supposed to arrive there was no booking at all so i need to call the taxi company by myself and fortunately there is a taxi available that day,0
 Bed was a bit small and air conditioning had a noise problem at some point was fixed quickly but recurred a few times,0
 Cleanliness Awful There were two pair of dirty underwear behind a desk chair Obviously housekeeping dies the bare minimum I was revolted Bed No mattress pad Gross Itchy sheets Because of my discovery of the underwear when I moved the chair to the desk I was obviously creepiest out fir the rest if my stay Staff Unfriendly and unhelpful ,0
 Havent figured out yet ,0
 We booked a trip with 2 rooms and in one room children of 16 and 14 however when we arrived they were given a double bed when I asked for a twin room as the boys didnt want to share a bed we had to pay a considerable amount extra for the twin room which we should have been told upon booking ,0
 Restaurant could be bigger,0
 This hotel needs maintenance or may be even renovation Bad hygiene I have never seen a four star hotel with a dirty lift elevator before Rubbish litter thrown in the left no body would bother to clean it Dirty bed sheets cannot be justified no matter how nice the staff were ,0
 Room wasn t bigger than what i have expected Wasn t that bad tho ,0
 Small stuffy room and uncomfortable bed The room kettle was out of order Footpath was being resurfaced outside our window ground level Room rate was quite expensive ,0
 Room had been made smaller what it should havebin Not enough room for clothes No bedside cabinets not much room to pass at the bottom of bed Not very good for 4 star,0
 The bathroom I didn t so much mind its smallness since I was travelling alone but what I resented was the fact that as soon as you ran water for a shower the bathroom turned into a swimming pool ,0
 The ventilation system worked throughout the night and was very loud even after turning the controller off Didn t get much sleep as a result ,0
 On arrival at Paddington Hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel The Hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis We received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for London we did not receive it ,0
 The room was way to HOT l went to reception and told them Thankfully it wasn t a problem they were able to change some settings at reception to cool air in our room and when we return that evening the room was nice and cool ,0
 Breakfast should be included with hotel price It s a good spread but too expensive for extra fee ,0
 There was insufficient hanging space for clothes There could have been larger cups for tea and coffee making facilities or even a teapot The room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for a couple exploring London ,0
 This hotel was not a hotel I choose before then they transferred a new hotel where it s name is park garden kessington They did not say me this situation before it is very interesting experienced for us we are shocked Nobody wants to go a hotel that they did not choose in Booking They had to notify me about the changing hotel but they did not do it ,0
 lack of advertising there are two of these hotels on the same street having arrived at the wrong one first and waiting at reception to be told that their sister hotel was another couple of minutes walk up the road ok no big deal it was a nice day ,0
 couldn t really work the mobile device and had to go down to find internet code ,0
 Like most London hotels the room is tiny smaller than the photos suggest ,0
 View was terrible I booked a triple room but with the sofa bed up u couldn t get round the room Bathroom tiny ,0
 Room was awful Constant buzzing air con room was dark and cramped Booked a luxury deluxe but the room felt like a standard No iron in the room Overall bad experience ,0
 Bed was very hard and bathroom would get pretty flooded from the shower but it was small so that might not be preventable ,0
 Ganska slitet n got bristf llig st dning Irriterande att det bara fanns tv l gen p belysningen i rummet och att b da s nglamporna styrdes med samma lysknapp ,0
 That i Had to change hotel first Because hot Water did not work at this property So i payed for 4 nigts in a suite But the first Night at the other hotel i just got a normal room ,0
 I couldn t point out anything,0
 Not even a conversation with the hotel staff when checking in The room was a deluxe double room didn t seem like it Seemed very small Considering that this was our honeymoon you would like those extras thrown in Like swan towels petals on the bed etc Not even a congratulations either ,0
 Very poky room Shower room was soaked after a shower and you had to fight with the shower curtain at the same time as having a shower Our room entertainment on the tv didn t work couldn t buy movies Staff didn t seem bother about our issues,0
 Rummet var mkt mindre n v ntat Mobilt element men endast ett str muttag Frukost var inte v rd pengarna r rigt frukostrum och h gljudd personal och det slutade med att vi t frukost ute varje dag L tt att h ra andra rum via ventilen i badrummet och matlukt fr restaurang ,0
 During our stay on both mornings we were woken at half 6 each mornig by a high peck noise coming from the pipes in the bathroom when we complained we were told it never happened by for we were given a 15 refund which was 40pound for the price of the hotel it should of been more by sleep on both nights was ruined ,0
 the only downside was the size of wardrobe not very deep and no chest of draws only bedside draws we stayed 2 nights so wasn t too much of a problem but if you had more luggage not much storage,0
 The mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife The room One of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage The lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening Only one comfy chair made TV watching awkward and difficult We did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast ,0
 The room 138 is small and I do not like having to shower in the toilet area Would much prefer a separate shower cubical this would stop me using this facility if I was given this room again as second time and not happy with the en suite facility Air con was adequate other guest complained of it on the day as well ,0
 The beds weren t very comfortable The room was stuffy but we were able to open the window ,0
 This is the forth time I have used this group of hotels and the 2nd time I have turned up and had the excuse of there is a problem with the boilers and you have been affected and we will have to relocate you I told them to stop using the same excuse when they overbook the hotel as it does not work for me They tried to convince me to go to South Kensington Hotel which is told rubbish I managed to get another room in the hotel Just very poor attitude to use on customers ,0
 The room was quite small and bathroom a little bit basic Also found that the a c made some strange noises and had to ask for a remote control for the tv as none in our room ,0
 My father staying in a single room with a twin bed paid almost as much as we did for 3 people in a large King room with sofa bed ,0
 The bathroom was badly designed You couldn t go in after someone had taken a shower as there was no shower basin just a trendy drain away style hole in the middle The tap didn t work properly either,0
 Do not book at this property absolutely no value for money Rooms were extremely small very dirty with lots of dust everywhere Bathroom was disgusting cracked walls mirrors and floors and toilet with no proper flush Room sizes were extremely small for 2 people less than 6sqm which is beyond human We felt like rats living there with no hygiene standard Absolute catastrophe for a 4 star standard equals more like a youth hostel in a remote area ,0
 The room was small ,0
 You advertised breakfast included in your booking com web posting When I completed the booking it did not indicate breakfast included Misleading I emailed you at booking com and received auto reply with no direct follow up to my inquiry I asked hotel staff at check in and was not offered the breakfast Your booking service is less than satisfactory in this regard The hotel is not 500 metres from Paddington Closer to 1200 metres ,0
 They take a temporary deposit from ur credit card to make sure you don t cancel and even after paying cash on checking the keep ur money from your card for a further 8 days after staying which is uncalled for also wanted 20 despite on checking for cover off mini bar of which I refused to pay to find out on arrival off our room the mini bar was empty so why need a deposit ,0
 I was charged 300 more than I should ve been and was never reimbursed the manager was very rude and not very helpful at all ,0
 My room was a compact double and it was really small made worse by a huge TV fixed to the wall which I had to squeeze past to get around the bed ,0
 Bedrooms,0
 The room was lovely and modern but some furniture was looking abit tired and I booked a room that said book now pay at property but I was charged on my credit card which wasn t released for 7 days after checking out ,0
 The floor in our room was very slippery and we thought we should have had a better room considering they had messed up our booking and we had originally had a room that had no hot water etc ,0
 Girls on reception weren t very friendly To request a late check out I had to call one hour before check out time 12 noon which was defeating the purpose of having an extra lye in as our flight wasn t until 9pm Even though the hotel wasn t fully booked was able to check via this website I couldn t book a late check out upon arrival ,0
 Incorrect room type allocated rectified for the second night of our stay but no financial compensation Problem with electricity in the room on our second morning took almost an hour to repair A smell of greasy food at the main entrance and reception not very welcoming ,0
 I felt like they tried to trick me when I paid with VISA card by offering the choice that I can pay in EUR which as far as I understand incurrs additional costs Why that ,0
 The room is so small the compact double room but no space for opening a suitcase everything shall be done on the bed Too expensive even considering the location ,0
 1 small window in room barely any light no view or fresh air Felt like a cellar Very small bathroom Expensive ,0
 Doorman and guests standing at the entrance smoking made it hard to get in and out Also once the sofa bed was up fro the three of us it made the room very very small ,0
 The carpeting in the corridor out side the room was worn out the hotel needs to pay attention to detail The bathroom was not replenished with Shower Gel and other items had to ask for it everyday ,0
 Receptionists that can smile or even respect you as a customer On check in it was great however on departure Not even a smile And why does every hotel in Paddington area require a photo identity Having travelled around the world with the exception of middle east country s only Paddington seem to have a hotel a trust issue all very frustrating and unnecessary ,0
 Noisy for some reason in the middle of the night you d hear the boiler sound which was extremely annoying since woke me up multiple nights One of the trainee staff came inside the room despite being told not to when they were searching for someone s bags It s nice that they help search Not when you are showering on the toilet ,0
 Would have liked fried eggs for breakfast as well if possible ,0
 We were given a very small room not in line with we booked but we were relocated to a bigger one Everytime we hada shower during the 4 days stayed the bathroom was a flooded,0
 No fridge in the room Very noisy heating system and very early and noisy housekeeping Very poor and expensive breakfast Cheaper to eat somewhere else ,0
 Really small room hit my head on the roof I m not 6 8 I m 5 9 my wife had nowhere to hang her dress Not good for our anniversary bit disappointed Think the room would be better use for the cleaner as storage,0
 The food was not as good as I would have wished We ordered room service the steak was overdone and the condiments bowl was full of HP sauce no vinegar mayonnaise etc ,0
 n a,0
 Our first night put in a rabbit hutch of a room unable to close door properly because bed was in the way The bathroom door also touched the bed The bathroom was just a small wet room no extractor fan took shower room full of water mirrors frosted over impossible to clear Hotel obviously taking advantage of customers using this room outrageous to claim it s a double room 219 ,0
 Although the wifi is working very well there is little to no signal in the rooms of the basement floor 1 Also the heating airconditioning system is a bit noisy ,0
 I felt on reflection that it was pricey for just a room,0
 Very little space in the room Bathroom was tiny Was unable to enter bathroom after having a shower due to wet room style shower which caused the floor to be very wet for a number of hours after Air conditioning unit made screeching noises when turned off or low fan And humming noise was constant when turned on Also if temperature was set at less than 20C the unit was extremely noisy Had to walk sideways to get from one side of room to the opposite side due to the position of the bed being so close to the end wall of the room ,0
 We didnt have a clue about london before we went so i think we might chose a more central location next time ,0
 Very noisy in early morning Cleaning stuff rude and unpleastant Barged in lift and then would not move to let us pass very rude couldnt speak english,0
 We felt like the room let us down this made us want to eat out and just use the hotel for sleeping ,0
 Cleaning could be a lot better,0
 Fire door immediately outisde my rooms banged frequently during the early hours Evening meal was served in the bar the restauarant downstairs was only for breakfast ,0
 Older style hotel room with dated furnishings Not very spacious for those travelling with larger bags ,0
 Hard to find a single plug socket easy in room wood effect on walls made the room feel small and enclosed heating didn t seem to work well was 26 but didn t feel even 22 maybe because room on ground floor and draft coming through the windows Didn t see the point of little entrance before getting in room especially there being no plug socket in there very disappointing,0
 Didn t end up with the original hotel we booked and we were meant to have deluxe rooms Which we didn t have,0
 Temp of room a little cool and also needed thicker duvet for our preference but minor complaint ,0
 we enjoyed our stay,0
 There was a leek in the roof above the shower in room 421 ,0
 The room was very gloomy despite being club room room service was very bad poor ventilation and location,0
 Beds are old and not comfortable at all Also the blankets need to be thicker or another blanket added especially during winter time ,0
 Remember to get a room that s not in the basement level B ,0
 I think a bed topper on the mattress would have let me sleep better I like hard beds but this one was a little too hard ,0
 It was bought as a present for my sister but even though I was promised the night before she could check in she was not allowed Ended up using nearly all her spends to pay for the room Her review follows The room service was wrong on the first night someone walked into our room and the fire alarm went off in the evening I slept eventually with the door barricaded with a small wooded contraption I cried once in the morning and once at night They are unbending in their rules and gave me a bottle of wine to apologise They admitted the information was wrong but the guy who spoke to me was in training I could not go out in the evening as could not afford it I had to stay in the hotel for the Friday and was able to spend what little money I had on the Saturday Oh and at breakfast I hope you don t get stuck in the little cupboard they have The deluxe double room had no charger next to the bed and the wardrobe is really for one person for one night When I had a shower I had to remember to move the toilet roll as it got soaked the night before Our anniversary was ruined apart from what we salvaged and this was all down to the hotel Very upset with their unbending policies They need to think about their customers ,0
 The walls are so thin you ll wake up every time someone passes the corridor Your bed will liteally shake when someone walks in 15m perimeter I couldn t get a good sleep on ANY night ,0
 Room was baking hot but phoned reception and they turned off the heating ,0
 The size of the bathroom was abit cramped ,0
 The elevator was too slow We had to order empty cutlery cups and glasses every day The room survive should have this changed for us everyday ,0
 I asked them by email for an earlier check in and they never answered back We arrived at the hotel about an hour before the regular check in time and they let as wait till the exact time The room was a little bit cold and the air condition was not working correctly The tables for the breakfast was very small ,0
 our room design could be better Needs small lights by the bed instead the only choice is to switch on VERY bright lights which are set in a very high ceiling above the bed Blinding ,0
 Was a bit strange going to the basement for a room ,0
 I booked a deluxe double and was told that the room had a queen size bed However the bed was pretty small The duvet was quite thin so I had to call down reception at 3am for a blanket Also the room was very small quite claustrophobic The next morning after checking out we went to the bar to have a coffee We are the only ones there the barman took our order then disappeared for 15 minutes and didn t make our coffees so we left Not good service at all ,0
 Sofa bed and the fact that you could not shut the door with the sofa bed up you had to lift it up to shut the door,0
 The breakfast room in the basement was a little chaotic with customers and staff everywhere The food was good but not a good dining experience not what I was expecting compared with the rest of the hotel ,0
 Hangar space limited ,0
 A little farther from Paddington Station than l expected 24hour room service would be nice ,0
 The room was a bit small but you d get over it as you d spend little time in the room with all the stiff you be doing around London,0
 the room could have been a lot warmer There was no visible heating in it but there were 2 electric radiators but because there were 3 of us we had nowhere to put them ,0
 The room was noisy at night either because if the water pipes or air conditioning People would also stand in the corridor and have loud conversations outside of my room not the fault of hotel just rude people I had the compact double room and it really is compact Wouldn t recommend for 2 people I m not a tall person and my feet were hanging off the bed Shower was very small but convenient if you want to use the sink sit on toilet and shower all at the same time I didn t but it s possible ,0
 I was expecting to get a better room as we booked deluxe double but the room was located on the ground floor did not have a bath only shower so I do not think it was a deluxe room as we originally booked ,0
 My room was right next to reception and really noisy ALL night with people coming and going and shouting Room was also TINY and we didn t even have the smallest ,0
 Room a bit dated and needed some TLC Iron leaked everywhere ,0
 After paying to secure the reservation I was asked to pay for the room upon arrival the money has been taken out of my bank account twice was advised that it was a pre booking that the money should be refunded into my account in 3 days Not happy my account has gone overdrawn if the money hasn t been refunded by tomorrow then I will contact customer service and get them involved ,0
 The only thing we didn t like was the wet room style shower in the bathroom However it was bearable ,0
 We were disappointed to find our room was not ready when we arrived at 4pm It was then ready after 15 20 mins so not too bad but as we were booked for dinner and a show in the west end it was stressful for us all at the time ,0
 There were a lot of stairs ,0
 Room was a little small but that would be expected from being located in a central area ,0
 We were switched hotels at the last minute and no one notified us Rooms were too small It s very likely they are the same size at all these same chains We had 3 adults and a baby with a baby bed Even without the baby bed there was hardly any room to walk through the room but we made it work However it was a nice place to stay in a decent location Lancaster Gate Station underground was closed when we were there or that would have been nice also ,0
 The room was a little cramped for 2 people considering the price that was payed for it ,0
 The room was cold on arrival the heating was turned off and it took a long time to warm up also it only single glazed ,0
 The check in girl was not very helpful basically she said I couldn t stay there because I didn t have photo ID I informed her I had stayed there before but she didn t care Ended up letting me stay The room didn t have no towels in it I had to call room service to get them The bathroom smelt very bad like old potatoes I will not be staying again ,0
 The room was tiny even by standards for having stayed elsewhere in the U K The room on the 4th floor got too hot and the ac unit did not work neither did the hair dryer so we kept the window open ,0
 The pipework in this building is very noisy and we could hear it people all night using the taps We also were originally placed in a room in the basement without windows which was not mentioned as a possibility in the room information ,0
 The shower was interesting as it was in the corner of bathroom with only the curtain separating it Needless to say the entire floor and a couple of walls and maybe the roll of tp were soaked following use ,0
 The bathroom could have a bathtub ,0
 We went to the wrong ParkGrand Paddington moments before and they were very rude staff before they told us that we were not staying in this hotel ,0
 The room was incredibly hot however as soon as I rang reception they lowered the temperature immediately so we could sleep I just wish I had rung them sooner and given them an opportunity to help out earlier I could fault their service ,0
 The room was to small and there was not enough room or hanging space No place to hang your coat or sit ,0
 One member of staff was particularly grumpy but all others were perfectly happy ,0
 There was constant cold draft coming from the window which made the room cold at night Even though the windows were closed it did not make any difference I hope the hotel can look into this matter ,0
 No closet in the room leakage from shower doors ,0
 I didn t book another night should have ,0
 Not being able to sleep very loud noice in room sounded like a generator Disappointed on the very little sleep I had ,0
 Minor issues No lamps next to bed only spotlights that are too bright No plugs next to bed for phone charger No ironing board and iron in room Major issues Heating system didn t work properly Impossible to control and was just too loud to have on while trying to sleep Ended up just turning it off which meant we were freezing all night Loud buzzing noise all night from either heating system or extractor from within wall cavity made it near impossible to go to sleep Rudely woken at 4 am by Idiotoic delivery men dropping off laundry Our room was ground floor next to the rear entrance Talking loudly non stop banging doors with engine on right outside our window for atleast an hour Totally unnacceptable If that wasn t bad enough at 9am we were again rudely woken by some prat outside our windows removing hundreds of bags of rubbish from the basement below our room onto the road ready for collection Absolutely no acknowledgment that paying guests were asleep less than a metre away from him and with the windows single glazing these loud people may aswel have been in our bloody room This room should not be in use with the current routines they have in place The whole experience was just a shambles After telling reception during check out we were brushed off with I will tell the relevant departments no mention of sorry or I ll arrange for a Manager to call you ,0
 The shower wasn t designed particularly well as everything around you either got very wet or you got stuck to the shower curtain ,0
 The only thing I d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were OK but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers Also as I am a genius booking com member I had free late check out but I wasn t able to find out whether I could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans ,0
 Our double bed was two twins pushed together and I kept falling into the gap Bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking I prepaid for our room 5 months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card I paid on I no longer had this The staff member insisted that I paid again on a bank card that I had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card I was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card I paid on After paying again on my only debit card it left me 150 short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take 4 working days I had prepaid so far in advance so that I could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london My husband and I very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the Weekend for us ,0
 No satelite tv No parking at the hotel closest parking was 5 10 minute walk away in a pay display carpark,0
 Rooms are a bit small without enough room to hang clothes in wardrobe Also not enough wall sockets we had to move furniture and look behind wall fascias ,0
 Tiny bathroom with no counter space ,0
 Nobody had told us that our original hotel was undergoing maintenance but it was all sorted very quickly,0
 Size of room small wardrobe space tiny for 2 people,0
 The size of the bathroom is very tiny especially in the standard room ,0
 The staffs attitude The cleanliness found nail clippings on the floor by the bed and also a dirty extension lead that was left in there by a guest before Health and safety plug socket loose on the wall ,0
 Didn t look like the photos online there were biscuit wrappers and rubbish on the floor by the bed ,0
 The room wasn t very warm even with the heater on the small vent in the roof wasn t enough for the room ,0
 Standard Room was no bigger than a closet stuffy and bathroom was a wet room very tiny Room suitable for one person for one night Staff very friendly and quick to respond when TV didn t work expensive for what we got,0
 Tried to overcharge me for breakfast I d already paid for Luckily I still had my confirmation email to prove it Hairdryer difficult to get to as positioned in cupboard over bedside table ,0
 However when we went up to our room the 3rd bed had not been made up so we had to wait for all the bed linen towels etc to be brought up Restaurant was absolutely boiling Is there anyway that it could be better ventilated ,0
 Our room was on the basement floor and there was a noise coming through the air vent the entire night which made it very difficult to sleep ,0
 Had no dislikes found the hotel to be just what we needed ,0
 The receptionists were not polite their English wasn t even that good to begin with The room was very tiny you could barely pass by the bed if I was a bit fatter I wouldn t be able to pass The bed sheets were not changed since day one there were stains The toilet was so tiny and the shower was horrible there is no way to shower without drowning the entire toilet The location wasn t that great and it took us a while to get in and out of the area ,0
 If anything the curtain rail was slightly off centre my partner only noticed as she spent a long time lying on her back,0
 The bed on our room wasn t very comfy the sofa was a lot softer and we would have shared that instead of the bed if it was bigger ,0
 I informed the reception when I checked out that one of the bathroom tiles were loose and raised I also explained that I had stubbed my toe on the tile I stressed that I was not complaining merely pointing out a fault that I thought needed attending to I was disappointed that the receptionist showed little to no interest,0
 I booked 2 nights in this hotel I have paid the total fee when I arrived at the hotel but they also take 160 poubds pending transaction from my bank account I will leave uk in several days and cancel my UK bank account but they did not return my money I sent them emails but they didn t have reply me I ll not recommend this hotel to my friends Disappointed ,0
 Room was tiny even though it was meant to be double deluxe room but staff changed us into another room quickly The heating system is really loud ,0
 n a,0
 the restaurant was not open in the evening meals had to be taken in the bar area Also no childrens menu or offer of smaller portions ,0
 The room was compact and efficient but lacked warmth very corporate and clinical feel,0
 The ventilation pipe was passing through my room and at certain moments at night it was producing much noise not letting me sleep well The room was really small and the shower tight ,0
 The room was small especially the double bed which was incredibly small The breakfast wasn t included in the room rate and expensive The wardrobes are not wide enough to hang more than one jacket They resemble the fridge door in their size ,0
 The air conditioner made a bird noise constantly We had someone look at it it stopped for about 30 min and started again We previously stayed at this hotel for the past 5 years this year the room was tatty we asked for an early check in by 1 2 hour the room was not ready for 1 hour after we arrived I do not believe we will stay there again I don t believe it was good quality for the price ,0
 You could hear the traffic although the hotel is not located near a main road you can hear vehicles passing by ,0
 Staff could pay better attention to detail Eg I booked a wake up call and never received it When I let them know that they basically didn t care ,0
 Rooms were uncomfortable not properly cleaned very little space for clothing no shower curtain in bathroom so the entire floor got wet ,0
 My only small issue was I thought room service could go on a little later as it s a chain hotel but not a huge deal,0
 Very small bathroom in effect a wet room Fine for me but could be a bit small for a less able or larger person ,0
 The rooms were extremely small wardrobe was not usable no where to hang up anything wet also can hear the shower running in other people s rooms below and above you,0
 You can easily hear people talking or walking at the corridor ,0
 The air conditioning unit was making a lot of strange sounds beyond those of a typical unit ,0
 Room was a bit cold and only a plug in radiator to warm it up Ventilation system made an annoying humming noise every so often ,0
 The evening dining facility was not so good with a bar menu meal had to be sent back although again the lady on duty was very apologetic ourselves and various guests could be heard making detrimental comments on items purchased ,0
 I had a bad experience with this hotel During check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me I felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around 2 miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system So I decided to to turn the table against them so I request from woman in front desk to show me the room For testing the water heating system by my self Suddenly her supervisor came I forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel It clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests During that an European guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly I start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality What a shame So the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location Later they change the room I will never book again in this hotel ,0
 I booked for 6 nights instead of 5 I contacted them within 5 minutes of the booking but as it was a special deal they refused to amend the booking even though I contacted them straight way The built in panelling in the room was a bit dated and made it very narrow and difficult to get around the end of the bed ,0
 A shower curtain There was none which is the style but it sprayed water everywhere on the floor,0
 The hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money You then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it ,0
 Relatively compact rooms and small bathrooms Limited closet storage space for clothes,0
 I confused this with the Park Grand Paddington which is a few doors down the street Their premium rooms are nevertheless rather small and kidney shaped OK for a 1 night stop over but hard to settle in to for longer ,0
 Room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night I ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful The only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold We had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night Consequently we all had no sleep It really wasn t acceptable The room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too Really marred our holiday Hotel offered 50 back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night Such a shame because this place could be really great ,0
 See above,0
 4 start Hotel should do more than a poor service Every thing is chargeable even water The size of the room is so small and the design Is very strange can not understand it The matters and pillow is very poor quality and had strong headaches every day morning ,0
 Views aren t fantastic and the plumbing pipes are a little noisy from other rooms ,0
 The one time I did stay here and wasn t moved the room was large but with artificial lighting all around the perimeter On the ground floor right behind reception so could get noisy and also no power sockets to recharge any items Badly designed room Someone from the hotel needs to spend a night in the room to see the issues ,0
 Compact double is a very small room tight wardrobe space safe not big enough for laptop no mini bar and or complimentary drinking water Certain furniture fixtures looked quite used and could do with replacement refurbishment All in all a pleasant hotel though ,0
 Although there is in room AC it seemed to make no actual difference to the temperature of the room,0
 The television and beside control didn t seem to work although that could have been me ,0
 Hot water working but worked out better for us in long run,0
 Shower room leaked water into the bedroom as the floor drainage wasn t appropriate Previous occupants had got the carpet wet which wouldn t be difficult You need to shower in minutes to prevent water seeping into the bedroom ,0
 Room was either way too hot or way too cold and window didn t open properly so had to have air con on to cool down but then became too cold no happy medium,0
 No new bottles of water to drink every day Also only get biscuits with coffee in room on first day The Air conditioner units just outside of the window makes a lot of noise during the night ,0
 Fire door near our room banged during the night slightly annoying and could wake you up ,0
 The amount of sugar and milk that is left for you to make coffee tea Unfortunately left a necklace in the room before we left for another location Was never located ,0
 We were on ground floor with great bay windows but it must of been bin collection day so a bit of an early wake up call ,0
 The bedroom appeared small with all the wood around it The breakfast room was tiny for a full crowd and as was the bar where people could not enjoy a drink without listening to the table next door ,0
 Buffet breakfast was a bit expensive Rooms were a bit tiny but manageable,0
 The evening dinning area needs to be improved ,0
 No privacy The staff can come in any time although you lock the room from inside I found that quite shocking Never seen anything like this in my life The staff will knock but will NOT wait long enough They just barge in Also the wardrobes are a mockery of the word The layout of things in the room is quite awkward i e location of the kettle power charging points the so called wardrobes everything is at user un friendly location in the room ,0
 Originally placed in the basement which is totally depressing without a window however I did ask to be moved and they happily obliged ,0
 We booked a deluxe room however the room was very small and it was difficult to change clothes for our night out therefore didn t seem like a deluxe room ,0
 the bed was too firm and the pillows too hard Also the lighting in the bedroom wasn t too good and there was nowhere to plug in chargers near to the bed ,0
 What s with the breakfast confusion Can t British hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts It was one price if booked the day before A higher price that morning Oops you re not on the list blah blah blah North American hotels have no problems dealing with this Put it on your room or pay on the spot No dual pricing So easy Please break the UK mode and make it easy ,0
 First night we had to stay in an extremely small room They did move us to a much larger room for the rest of our stay ,0
 Not much The bar closed earlier than I would have liked Surrounding area didnt have a lot going on but close enough to paddington station,0
 Our room was not serviced The bed was two single beds pushed together ,0
 The air conditioning was not working and I had to change the room in next day And I could not sleep well that night ,0
 The tea and coffee making facility was poorly positioned on bed side table in my opinion this could potentially be very dangerous due to limited space Need to find an alternative area ,0
 Suit space is very small bathroom without a tub or shower breakfas area is small closed and crowded I styed in suit with king bed size but I foud it tow mattresses not one with king size it s horrable while you are sleeping,0
 The heating didn t work Certainly not worth paying this much Staff were not very helpful or apologetic but rather claimed their screen in the reception said it was warm Soy milk at breakfast was either old or diluted with water,0
 Fire alarms kept on going off randomly bit disturbing Lighting in the room wasn t that great But overall a good stay with minor drops ,0
 The staff was very in co operative and the rooms were awful to say the least I was finally shifted to a bigger room but when I requested for check out till 3 PM on Friday the lady told me that till 2 it was okay and she will try for 3 Then she says that she will do it only till 1 and not till 3 No reason was given for this at all ,0
 Size of the bedrooms were small Had to phone each time for a ironing board Breakfast was mediocre No comfort in the bar Each time upstairs flushed the toilet or had a shower you could hear the water flushing down the pipes in our bathroom ,0
 deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised Just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller Bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower ,0
 It wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com The room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room After we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working It took a long time to deal with this in the evening The showers were weak in both rooms One day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed Overall too many problems ,0
 The automated room was a bit hard to understand for non frequent travellers Staff should try to explain system or ask if the guest is familiar Was moved from one hotel to a sister hotel and offered free breakfast in recompense But no one told the sister hotel and no one told me how I could go about getting it ,0
 Deluxe double was tiny My partner is 6ft and hanging off the bed We were next to an elevator so loud noises all night Shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure TV was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly If u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable But saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us ,0
 Very poor value for money Very poor room despite it being what was classed as a deluxe Bed against window so had to scramble down the bed to get out Very disappointed and first time I ve had a poor hotel from Booking com,0
 The breakfast Bleak and poor for that price Even the pictures of it were faded and didn t give you a good impression of what was offered Should have been included in the price of the room if that is all they can serve ,0
 The room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud Every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain The room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat There is only enough wardrobe space for about 5 things to hang in When I asked why I hadn t got any complementary water I was told it was because I booked through you I made a fuss and did get it in the end but I felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over 350 for the two nights ,0
 Room was tiny and dark I got moved around to a different property one block away because Park Grand had hot water issues Then when I checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location Too much money for such a small room ,0
 The main mattress for the bed is too soft Feel painful for the back after sleep overnight The mattress for the sofa bed is too weak I still can feel the springs They can be good if you can choose the medium firm mattresses ,0
 Due to it s location its decor the the lounge bar area was not very comfortable to sit relax in It was the walkpath to go to all the rooms ,0
 Room was too small for 2 people A double bed with 2 mattresses does not pass as a twin Overpaid for what I got ,0
 The double room was so small there was no room to store bags Two people were unable to dress at the same time The walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use Friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided The gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room Very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating ,0
 The shower water is hard I couldn t get the soapy feeling off even after washing for a while Also on arrival at the airport I called the the telephone given to me at booking which took so long to answer I also found the direction address given to me unhelpful In fact a lady on the line directed me to apparently another branch of the hotel that the one I booked for was under renovation I turned up at the place I booked and found no renovation going on and busy and I got the room I booked for Perhaps it was a mixup ,0
 The bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position On showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area The bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily It was just awful I will not book this hotel ever again in this Paddington area of London ,0
 Everything else you don t expect big and lavish rooms while staying in Central London however a room which has just 18 inches of space around the bed Washroom was also a disaster 140 plus per night is deserves more ,0
 One of us mobility impaired wish it were a little closer to Underground station,0
 the bathroom wasn t really hotel standard No counters to do makeup or blow dry hair The room was too close to the stuff pantry noisy all through the night Hotel stuff didn t bother to replenish towels or make beds properly Carpet in the room was dirty from the day we checked in,0
 We arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again Then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room They then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day It then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room The bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what I can only describe as orange zest all over it This was at 02 30 am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered Then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at 09 00 wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until 12 00 to check out We left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again It really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely But at the tune of 173 00 for less than 10 hours we wont ever be going back ,0
 The hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves I booked a Double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that I was checking in late there was NO room for me when I showed up at midnight There was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing They moved me down the street into a SINGLE and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room BOOO Don t just walk run away from these crooks ,0
 Room a bit small ,0
 The room had a terrible view of a scruffy building and the windows were disgusting Lack of parking and staff said it would be OK to park where we did Ended up with a parking fine Ruined a birthday suprise I had planned for months for my partner Wouldn t stay again ,0
 Fairly newly renovated looks great but bathroom plumbing isn t The space is small and okay if you re travelling solo ,0
 We were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained Web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen Wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple The rooms were too compact Wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles,0
 Delayed checking despite not arriving till 7pm 3 bed was child size and like a camp bed towels for 3 provided but not cups glasses toiletries they were all for 2 Breakfast time was crowded in a small area meaning staff could not keep up with demand despite their best efforts No where near a 4 star more like 2 We don t understand how the AA rated as a 4 star Definitely not worth the discounted cost,0
 Small room at basement floor,0
 Room very small but spotlessly clean ,0
 no refrigerator in the room you can ask the staff to put your food in the kitchen refrigerator Very small room I think the bedsheets were not changed everyday,0
 Some of the furniture was very dated and needs replacing I didn t like our club room being situated in the basement ,0
 The bathroom was quite small And no bath ,0
 Would like to have had a bit longer for check out but this didn t really cause us too much of a problem ,0
 The chairs in the breakfast room had no padding Towels need to be bigger as I m a average sized person and they didn t go around me ,0
 The room we have been given was not as I saw in the picture at and the bed was too small and the room was too small No places to hang my clothes,0
 The cleaning staff usually forget to replace toiletries that have been used up ,0
 we booked twin room but when we arrived they gave us double rooom Anyway the other day they offered me the Twin room ,0
 Breakfast wasn t great our hotel had maintenance probs taken to Hyde Park grand hotel instead room was okay some parts a bit tired looking had discount online nights stay would have been a little disappointed if paid full price,0
 When we checked in at the given time of 2pm our room was unavailable and would be told we would have to wait in another smaller room for 1 hour 3 hours later our room was still unavailable Due to having plans my husband 20 year old daughter and I had to get ready and prepared for our night out in a very small room We then had to leave our belongings with the staff who said they would put our things in our room when it was available Fair enough our belongings were in our booked room when we returned to the hotel 4 hours later however we found this very unsettling There was no sofa double bed pull out in the room like there was shown in photos there was a tiny bed set up with a very thin mattress which my daughter said was uncomfortable ,0
 A single room allocated on first night for two persons was not acceptable The price of breakfast was too high as we did not have the cooked meal ,0
 Not the hotel I booked room too small to swing a cat in inflexible cancellation policies,0
 Bar area poor staff didn t know what they where doing a lot of waiting around at reception poor facilities in reception area ,0
 Basement room cramped pics shown and actual room are different With a queen sized bed in the room you can forget being able to walk about no place to put bags ,0
 No plug in basin which wasn t attended to Basement room very claustrophobic Carpet was dirty ,0
 The beds and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable Room had seen better days Interior needs refreshing There was what seemed like animal hair on the bed linen so unsure if the room we were given actually allowed pets Found toe nail clipping on the floor,0
 Small bed rooms some in basement with no views like a dungeon could only hang 4 items of clothing up in cupboard Very crushed dining room no room between tables ,0
 More than 450 yards from tube station and my partner struggled to walk Bed up against window Couldn t get cold water from tap ,0
 Wet room bathroom meant whole floor would be wet after a shower personally prefer a separate shower otherwise great ,0
 One of the two matress was very soft Maybe the variety of breakfast is a bit short for a stay longer than a week ,0
 Eventually when I returned there was only one room left Probably the worst in the hotel Some staff were poorly trained gave misinformation ,0
 The small bed,0
 There was no iron or ironing board available within the room which is only a minor complaint ,0
 The air conditioning in the room did not work well ,0
 One Bed was broken room 801 triple room Breakfast was average everyday is the same breakfast The toilet location is very bad no space for the other leg,0
 Wish we could have stayed a bit longer ,0
 The mattress could have been better didn t have a good night sleep ,0
 The Club Room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light The cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room The tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years The room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter Don t believe the pictures on the website The staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when I had the ordacity to complain ,0
 Not unusual in London some rooms are small we upgraded to a bigger room for not much more money all the rooms look very newly refurbished and very well fitted out ,0
 The room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for 2 of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes The rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good If I had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it The UNenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet Again if 2 sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc ,0
 Sofa bed uncomfortable Very unhelpful concierge refused to allow customers to contact alternative staff who could make decisions,0
 After hauling 4 suitcases across London we were informed there was a boiler problem and we had to be moved After my initial reservations the sister hotel just around the corner exceeded our expectations The staff are truly amazing and went out of their way to ensure a great stay,0
 Hotel was just a bit quiet for what we had wanted Ideally it would have had more of an atmosphere around the bar or something in the evenings ,0
 Bathroom sink backed up when very little water was run Black mold on shower floor floor draining shower Rooms a little cramped for space Travelling with 5 people could have used more help with luggage on arrival ,0
 The meat in the breakfast was pork so we couldn t eat it during our whole stay since we are muslims ,0
 The facilities are not that much there is no refrigerator or iron I reserve a room with 2 single beds but there are no rooms with single beds in the hotel ,0
 On arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite I was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com However we were given 2 rooms on second day due to pressure Most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood Sujith,0
 Small room bathroom spaces,0
 The underfloor heating in the bathroom was a bit hot but better than none There was only 1 bedside table ,0
 I think some bedrooms are quiet small but if only stay for one or two days is OK ,0
 The fact that I wanted to extend the stay which they were unable to do where as when I rang them before leaving I was told I could So then I had no choice but to pay extra I felt the staff was useless ,0
 The staff at the bar was not really qualified WE ordered a bottle of Prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us 10 minutes later that WE would need to pay as they are closing We got a room in the basement which is considering the price I would have liked to know prior to my stay ,0
 Not sure it was the problem of the hotel or booking com The triple room I booked was canceled due to inefficient credit card I provided However the card is totally fine when I checked in to the hotel This cost a great trouble during our first night in the hotel ,0
 As mentioned staff have no authority to help the guest always they have to back the main office,0
 they gave us a room in the basement then when we wanted to change we had to wait more than one hour we were there at 8 pm don t know they did this because was a late arrival But it was a very bad beginning and not easy to get over because the second room provided had a window over a climatisation area and was very noisy 24 hour ,0
 The first girl on reception was a bit over the top the rest of the staff were lovely I was over charged for two extra nights I just emailed hoping to get a refund,0
 First room 802 was under the dining room and was extremely noisy scrapping of chairs on the floors woke Up by the noise Did complain and the staff who were very very helpful moved us to a room that was smaller but quieter so we had a very nice sleep,0
 The gym is in the basement floor at the end of a long corridor Not so encouraging to use because of its location ,0
 Bedroom was like a walk in wardrobe Staff had very limited English Wasn t asked if I slept well on either nights Room had a loud running water noise all night Premier inn hotels are x20s better,0
 the room was at the back of the hotel and the window was looking at another guests window poor light ng was coming through it was like a dungeon ,0
 The room was very small for the price and the wet room toilet was very very small so if you had a shower it would get the whole floor wet The room was hot and we could only open the windows about 2 inches ,0
 The staff in room service over the phone were rude the bathroom was a wet room which flooded everytime you had a shower as the plug was blocked the room was very small just big enough for a double bed ,0
 Bathroom was ridiculously small and tight Shower sprayed all over the small floor making it slippery as did the tiny sink The rooms are faded and dated and didn t strike me as very clean Would not book here again ,0
 Maybe some better refreshments in the room instead of wine but other than that couldn t fault it ,0
 Didn t appreciate the small room originally allocated given I was staying 7 nights Had issues with the bathroom of the new room allocated as well but friendly staff sorted it out ,0
 I hated the fact that there was no Lip on the shower the entire bathroom was wet after one of us had a shower never saw this in a hotel before The room was very small for a so called deluxe double The hair conditioner was never replaced ,0
 We were given a twin beds pushed together that kept separating whenever someone went near the middle and also were given a room in the basement had a frosted window so there was some natural light but not able to open it or have a view Asked for both things to be fixed and the staff were unable to do anything except put a sheet over the two beds Staff were generally unhelpful and snooty no information given at check in,0
 As a family of three we needed the fold out bed which was really uncomfortable The head lower than feet and a metal bar could felt across back ,0
 there was no plug beside the bed for charging my phone ,0
 I requested a tomato soup in the evening from the bar The service was very bad the place was empty but they took ages to bring the soup It was awaful soup the worse I ever tried just a red color with heavy layer of fat with no taste disgusting For dinner eat outside the hotel there are acceptable resturants around the area ,0
 Couldn t see a hairdryer but didn t ask so it may have been available ,0
 A C in lobby was not operational during check in but not the fault of staff Felt badly for them as we were soon ensconced in our a c room ,0
 A lot of chipped and broken furniture Not much room in restaurant for a busy hotel Television was confusing to operate Loud air conditioning ,0
 At the location we booked they said there were issues with the room so we had to go to a different location something this hotel seems to do a lot looking at the other reviews The other location was just around the corn we but the room we were given was definitely not the size we booked ,0
 No curtains in room and staff very unhelpful when told about them told we should have complained the night before but we did not notice as it was late when we got to the room Staff refused to deal with the complaint ,0
 N a,0
 Bedrooms are way too small also double beds of three quarter beds Booking show you photographs for their larger rooms for their standard double rooms,0
 Called up hotel to ask if I could leave a bag two days prior to check in and was informed this was OK On coming to the hotel I was informed I could not do so I would not have minded if I was given the correct information when I first called Secondly the receptionist on duty did not handle the situation well she was unsympathetic and said I may have misunderstood what was told to me by phone implying either I do not understand simple English or perhaps am too stupid to understand The halogen lights in the room are too bright and glaring ,0
 None,0
 Noisy old floor,0
 The room was just a bit compact Fine for a solo traveler but I wouldn t have wanted to be sharing Although having said that the bed was very comfy ,0
 Wardrobe space could have been bigger,0
 Room was very small and the wardrobe is only about 4 inches deep within a wall panel the bedside table below it made it very difficult to reach If only there for a night this would be acceptable but there was 2 of us for 4 nights This was described as a deluxe room and was told be reception staff that you need to book a club room to get anything bigger ,0
 Room and shower room very small Shower room was pointless as water just went everywhere and had to use all the towels to dry so that I could continue using facilities Lady serving drinks in bar was not qualified to serve as had no idea how to mix certain drinks ,0
 Didn t like the first bedroom we were put in was in the basement dark and claustrophobic Given a better room on 2nd floor Breakfast room was bit small and very warm ,0
 firm pillows,0
 left my earrings behind called half an hour after check out the room hadn t been cleaned it was 5 minutes later but they couldn t find the earrings I saw them before leaving and believe they were taken,0
 Very small room the shower room could have been a lot cleaner as it was a wet room but very small the water covered the floor so using the toilet after someone had showered was very very slippery ,0
 The breakfast was crowded the restaurant small and food wasn t piping hot We were advised of WiFi but this wan t available in our room as was in the basement meaning we had no phone signal either not all bad ,0
 Room was a little small and 2 nights was enough ,0
 Rooms on the 4th floor are extremely small You have to wait in line to have breakfast the space where they serve breakfast is claustrophobic ,0
 The layout of the room was a bit awkward Otherwise our stay was lovely and we were very pleased with the accommodation ,0
 Only stay here if a loud fan in the room does not bother you Even when I switched it off it was still really noisy The result minimal sleep Not ideal when all you want is a peaceful nights sleep ahead of a busy day ,0
 What s not to like ,0
 Hot breakfast didn t look very good very pale scrambled eggs not quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel and breakfast Very limited wardrobe space ,0
 The continental breakfast was a bit too expensive ,0
 I asked the desk person to order taxi for certain time but because tube down no taxis The person should have let me know right away unable to book taxi as had plenty of time instead I had to run with all my luggage and missed my bus Cost me additional money to get next bus ,0
 Breakfast too expensive ,0
 More coffee sachets and some juice soft drinks in the empty mini bar would have been good ,0
 Got there at 12 15 to leave bags was told Room would be ready for 1 30 when we came back to hotel at 14 00 was not ready and had to wait another 15 minutes,0
 The room we were in only had a view of rooms across the other side of the building ,0
 bigger dining area for breakfast breakfast queus where possible if you are not an early bird this may be partially solved by recommending breakfast in bed for guests ,0
 Beds are terrible Lumps and tilting Building is run down,0
 I was moved to this hotel on checking into my original hotel Receptionist informed me that because of the change I was going to get breakfast inc when I went to the room I had been allocated it was very small in comparison to my original room I had booked I was disappointed and told staff who informed me that it was the only room available but I could check with her again in the morning Breakfast was ok but a very small area to move around in Think I was probably overcharged as well ,0
 My bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security It took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious I lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management The management did not even apologies for what has happened I would advise Booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel Imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel Very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour ,0
 The staff is unorganised I ve booked the hotel through booking com and I ve paid for the room in advanced The staff kept on letting me put in my card again and again thinking that I haven t pay yet Which made me late for the meeting Also I ve arrived an hour later than the time they set for the check in and my room is still not ready ,0
 The room was slightly cramped There was an unnecessary mix up with the registration which resulted in our getting a smaller room but had free breakfast thrown in instead ,0
 The hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really I surprised from them They should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business Bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in UK we like UK Thanks,0
 Bathroom was very tiny ,0
 The breakfast area seemed to be too small to accommodate all the guests Every time we came there was a waiting time to be seated However well managed by the staff ,0
 Maybe a little nicer view For 2 nights though no grumbles ,0
 View from room was of a wall looking at another part of the building ,0
 We ended up in a very small room up many flights of stairs even by London standards and no one ever came to fix the TV Because we were relocated to the attic we did get free breakfasts ,0
 The room was very compact and the bathroom was a space saving wet room a bit of a squash for 2 people but manageable for a couple of nights ,0
 Bathroom was small and with few shelves or places where to put personal stuff such as combs cream shaver etc Room lights were poor no night lights for raeding Hair dryer inside a wardrobe not accessible from the bathroom only to be used from the bed Furniture in wood needed maintenance ,0
 Room was dark and cramped not great value for money ,0
 The room is too small especially the toilet It does not have a proper shower area and everything is wet after one is taking a shower ,0
 The shower flooded the floor every time The basement room had no opening windows to a grotty storage yard The bar shut too early ,0
 Slight back room noise in our room from outside the staff did try to deal with it but couldn t do anything about it but did offer alternatives,0
 We were transferred to grand park paddington court and was not able to see the rooms I booked The court s room toilet and bath is small not suited for 2 persons as expected,0
 room was on the ground floor named club room indeed good in size but with strange dispositioning of wardrobe hairdryer ,0
 Despite 5 rooms being paid for IN FULL in advance with a company credit card the hotel were still worried about something what I don t know so they insisted the person named on the credit card to be present even though they had already been paid Ridiculous One of our travellers paid for breakfast then when she sat down for breakfast they told her she had not paid when she had We will NOT be using this hotel again ,0
 The room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both The corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen It was one of the most disgusting hotels I ve stayed at It certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it ,0
 The breakfast buffet was ample but not high quality products I would suggest going elsewhere for a good English breakfast ,0
 We were there for 5 days it would be nice to have something different for breakfast not the exact same thing everyday There was only one elevator so sometimes it was a bit of a wait ,0
 I was moved on arrival despite only booking that day Apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in The hotel I moved to was further away from where I needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere I d have chosen to stay Overpriced and dissatisfied ,0
 Everything was fantastic only thing that could have been better is that my bed was too short ,0
 We booked a deluxe double room for 3 nights spent two nights in a compact double room No deluxe double rooms were available for us We also didnt get fresh towels on day two Definitely not 4 stars ,0
 There were no real restaurant facilities only the breakfast room and then the bar ,0
 Really helpful staff but staff were not allowed to kept the bar open after our visit to The Shard so eight of us had to have a drink in one bedroom,0
 Basement room so no natural light Couldn g get room service on one of the nights Listed as 4 Star Hotel I wouldn t rate it that high compared to others I have stayed in ,0
 Room not available on time Staff helped someone behind us before helping us Hotel insisted on photocopying my identification which I refused breakfast disappointing,0
 The room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel We had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags Thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage Another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty The window was also small due to the location of the room within the building ,0
 The people behind the desk really ought to be able to read the details of a booking properly to avoid guests being misdirected to a considerably smaller room This took too much time to correct ,0
 Bed was hard as a rock Worst nights sleep ever Bedroom was squashed was tiny no need for the word deluxe far from it No breakfast included and already paid 141 pound to stay Never staying again ,0
 Rooms are slightly small and there is just a little noise from the corridor because the floor is wood ,0
 There is no shower cabinet but the shower is only separated via curtain The complete bathroom was wet after taking 10 minutes shower At check in they offered to give us a local smart phone and we signed some papers It was supposed to be at room but we never received the phone even after calling the reception from the room twice When we asked at reception they apologized for it and told us there was a problem but I found it quite weird ,0
 poor staff that couldn t help me having to pay for the room before I checked out having a damp basement room that shouldn t have been rented out water stains on the ceiling,0
 The booking was done for Deluxe Double room and from 23rd I called them ahead to tell them I will be checking only on 24th Morning I land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself Once it got unblocked they provided me a Compact Room where if you walk you will hit a wall When I enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the Victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors When I was not buying the story they provided me the actual Deluxe Double Room that is more comfy The staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at During all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his Palace ,0
 The most expensive and also the smallest room with minimal facilities that we stayed in for over a month in Europe but hey that s London Consistent with most other hotels in this area for the price ,0
 Didn t dislike anything,0
 The rooms could be refreshed there s a different design on the photos than in reality Also the airconditioner could be refreshed it was a bit smelly but fortunatelly we didn t needed so we could turn it off ,0
 Room is quite small ,0
 Pretty tight space Tiny bathroom ,0
 room beside outside air con which came on and off during the night which was noisy breakfast very expensive at 12 when you could go across the road for 3 50,0
 The bedroom furniture was a bit tired and the wash hand basin was cracked ,0
 Was a bit a a walk from Paddington not ideal when dragon a case,0
 We recived a groud floor room where the windows where located above the staff s smokeing area The hotel blocked the amount of money coresponding to one night payment from my creditcard an after 1 weak I still didn t reciveit back ,0
 Noisy neighbour,0
 a socket for plugging your phone next to the bed ,0
 Room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited London itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and I mean everything is so grossly overpriced The city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but I will never visit London again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant ,0
 The facilities were very basic Breakfast was expensive and extra The location is a little out the way and the food offer is very basic The room was very basic bed was comfortable Check out was a nightmare ,0
 got moved to park grand paddington court and was allocated to the basement should have a choice of not preferring basement before,0
 I was expecting a delivery at the reception and despite having a confirmation of the delivery the night staff refused to give it to me arguing that it has never been delivered It is only when I ve threatened them to call the police that my package suddenly reappeared without the slightest apology Outrageous I strongly advise you to chose another hotel if you have any concern for your belongings ,0
 The room for the price When I went through booking com I looked at the pictures under the room I was booking The room I got and the pics of the room was completely different ends of quality I m lucky I complained and they gave me an upgrade 150 pounds for this I wouldn t have paid 75 for it ,0
 my only issue was at check in where the reception staff sought to take an imprint of my credit card using an old swipe machine Although this was procedure I objected to any swipe of my card I am happy to leave holding deposit for additional costs but refused The staff to be fair didn t argue I have stayed at sister hotel without problem ,0
 Breakfast is not very good especially the scrambled eggs were tasteless Bedsheets very hard and itching Skin was very rough afterwards for days Please change your detergent,0
 Air conditioning awkward to control Would rather have been able to open a window especially while asleep ,0
 there was a terrible noise all throughout the night sounded like there were pipes rattling really loud every time I opened the bathroom door i could hear next door as thought they were in the room with us The hotel charged me a 91 retainer prior to arrival which i still havent been refunded ,0
 Room was changed at arrival Not sure how was the original one supposed to look like The one we got was a bit dated otherwise ok ,0
 They dont clean the room very well i give them 7 from 10,0
 Menu and lack of room service at certain times Some rooms are really noisy you can hear full conversations of the people next door There are other rooms where a huge fan goes off outside The building needs better Windows to keep the noise out ,0
 Breakfast could be better More yogurt choices larger croissants more fresh fruit Service was great there and in the bar Cappuccino was bitter Machine may need cleaning ,0
 Rooms are very small hardly any space to move Every day 2 small bottles of water be provided There should be atleast one more electric socket ,0
 The room is very very small The room was not cleaned daily So far from the stations tube and bus It s for sure not a 4 stars hotel as it s part of a residence building ,0
 Went for a club room Badly designed with bed base taking up way too much space making it hazardous in the night added furniture wasn t helpful and the only plug points were in the drop down desk tv could only be viewed from bed so two chairs were no use and neither was the formal desk bathroom was a wet room cubicle that soaked everything when in use as the shower curtain kept sliding away,0
 It was a very noisy hotel We were woken at 6 30 by the people upstairs walking backwards and forwards across the room and could hear toilets flushing etc We were in the basement No other complaints,0
 I booked a deluxe twin room As per the photos it looked good enough When we got into the room which was hardly 3m x 3m I thought I made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with 10 cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back The room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage Staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse Good staff but greedy greedy management and owners Really bad experience ,0
 They must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night Indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in Not a real negative but after a hard day working in London after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then Room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which I had to do since the signal was poor However it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter They seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard Room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all There was a small long thin vase with 2 real Carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as I tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk I mopped the water with a towel btw The Air Con was making a racket so I turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless Despite consuming several pints at the Mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length I only got 3hrs sleep But I don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs I was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms During checkout I wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it Room 114 guys beware ,0
 Service in the bar was slow at lunchtime when we ordered a salad Another time we sat waiting for someone to come and take a snack order ,0
 My room was in the basement If I needed to stay more than 1 night that would make me feel uncomfortable I should have been told during booking that the room was in the basement ,0
 They assign you a different room then you reserved and lie in your face that it s the same one Insects on on bedclothes They give you one towel for two guests The air conditioning was going crazy loud every 15 minutes during the night The room is so small it s hard to walk ,0
 The shower was cold and unfortunately so was the room The little heater provided didn t work at all ,0
 15 min walk from Pasdington station My room was on 1 floor was a bit dark and very much noise from the outside The shower is just a hole in the floor so the floor of the bathroom is always wet,0
 We were made to move hotels because of hot water issues The mattress was yellow with stains If i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room I was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned The headboard was stained The staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control A second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge ,0
 Boiler broken in first hotel had to be moved to a sister hotel then they got my room wrong putting me in a single with a broken telly,0
 Street side a little noisy in evening but quiet after midnight Wardrobe door with mirror on inside needs a hook to hold it open when using the hairdryer ,0
 Booked via booking com and paid extra 10 to have the refundable option and to pay on check out However the hotel didn t inform me that before my stay they were going to take half the money out the week before my stay resulting in me nearly cancelling my card Also I had to pay on check on no issues to either but should have been informed ,0
 Rooms are small for a traveller of 6 2 Bathrooms wet rooms are awkward Windows need to be double glazed as constantly woken up during the night with deliveries etc outside Aircon heating doesn t really work that well,0
 small room small double bed not what we expected from a deluxe room Breakfast was not included in the price we paid on booking could have got a better price from the hotel including breakfast if booked direct ,0
 My security key to enter the door was disabled each time I returned which was frustrating as I had to walk back and forth to get the key activated ,0
 No wifi signal First time room was tiny Spoke to reception moved to bigger room Tap in the bathroom doesn t work properly,0
 Room should have a fridge for fresh milk and soft drink storage Soft drinks and better biscuits should be provided in the room,0
 There was no bar to speak of there was a fairly spartan room serving drinks but it wasn t conducive to having a nice drink Our room was a bit cold and the heating didn t appear to work plus it hadn t been cleaned properly the bathroom bin was full of someone else s stuff ,0
 The bed was too hard The bathroom was tiny and the shower was not powerful at all The only mirror in the room was on located on the inside of the cupboard which didn t open fully so the mirror was not accessible The fridge didn t work properly all my drinks were warm the next morning ,0
 N A,0
 The air condition was noisy when on or off so interfered with my sleep There was also a little bit of a leak coming from the shower head The fire alarm had gone off as well Could have done with 2 room keys As my daughter had gone off to do her own thing and so did I She got to the room before me so had to wait for me to let her in as I had the room key ,0
 There was a strange smell in the hotel and our room was next to a machine that make a lot of noise ,0
 The smoke alarm went off several times after 1am just because someone from another room had a shower and left the door open Too noisy ,0
 Plumbing quite noisy Room not large enough to have a chair to sit in Breakfast was additional and a little expensive ,0
 Staff not overly very helpful or assisting on checkin about the hotel or facilities ,0
 The room rate is too high compared to the services provided The room service could have been better I stained my sheets with coffee and makeup on my first night and when my room was cleaned the next morning the cleaners failed to change my sheets ,0
 You could hear most things in the adjacent bedrooms and because there were no net curtains or light blinds and my window was facing the internal lightwell if I opened my curtains I could see straight into the bedroom opposite ,0
 No window in the room ,0
 I didn t like the very small window in the attic room made me feel a bit claustrophobic Would have been nice to have a small bedside light for reading ,0
 Top floor was really warm had windows open the entire stay even though it was 10 degrees outside ,0
 even though we were told we had been upgraded the room was quite small ,0
 No control for heating small wardrobe space and nowhere to hang coats The room was very big though so not much of a problem ,0
 The bathroom was very small and had no actual shower cubicle or tray just a shower curtain and a drain It worked well enough but the addition of a shower tray would have made it much more pleasant to use ,0
 The staff on arrival weren t clear in fact one told me my booking wasn t with them and I was at the wrong hotel Also at the time of booking i d been informed the room was paid when in fact it had only been reserved the staff were quite rude handling this situation When I got to my room I called for room service as I was shattered I was told by a member of staff that I couldn t order anything as the kitchen was closed she was rude in the manner in which she said this and this ultimately left me feeling frustrated I went out to grab something and used a plate within the room there was a can opener on top of the plate which was encased in food or remains of something this made me feel sick Someone had obviously not checked the cleanliness of this area in some time Great location staff could do with customer service training I would never stay there again ,0
 Standards rooms are small but price is low for central London Club rooms are decent size ,0
 The room was a little cramped but somewhat expected for London ,0
 bathroom a little small,0
 Maybe the staff could have introduced themselves by name on check in the create a more personalised check in,0
 The room was a little bit warm There was a fan in the room but it didn t make much of a difference ,0
 The room was too small we paid for a delux double but it was tiny the aircon system is also too noisy ,0
 Their idea of separate beds was two mattresses 3 cm apart from each other with no possibility to move them The feedback form in the room was for some other hotel chain ,0
 The maid service was a little hit and miss glasses not cleaned replaced sugar not replaced there was no mobile signal in our room We paid extra for a club room but didn t really see any benefit the room itself was at the back of the hotel with no view apart from a wall and the only upgrades I noticed were 3 pieces of fruit and some rather scratchy robes ,0
 Rooms was dated not particularly clean and with a very noisy air conditioning unit in the room when opening the windows because we were near the restaurant we had more noise from those units Poor considering this was a deluxe room needed a complete refurbishment,0
 Rooms were much smaller than I thought Thought it was a 4star hotel and did not seem like it Good thing i got a good price from booking com ,0
 Couldnt fault it ,0
 The power in the room didn t work unless you gave the slot on the wall a bang The shower screen was half broken so a lot of water went all over the floor,0
 Air con didn t want to work and room was freezing We had a little heaters but it took hours by the time room was nice and warm ,0
 We had a deluxe double room that on initial entry was dirty and in a poor state desk was broken and the TV didn t work properly Not what I expected for a 4 star ,0
 Room very small but only stayed one night not a big problem,0
 Checking the fridge for food and drink left behind would have been good A little more milk in the room would have been nice We weren t really there longer enough to request more ,0
 However I did not like how I went into the first room and the ceiling was all opened and I went to reception and instead of doing a room move straight away they doubted my word had to check first and then they moved me plus they knew it was a special occasion so they could be more careful with how they do things,0
 The location wasn t the best for where we were going but nice to be away from the centre,0
 Slight mix up and had to go tongue sister hotel then the sent me back to the original as there was a problem with the original room Room was stated as delux but was quite small,0
 Check in wasn t available when we arrived at 10am However it wasn t really a big issue as we could leave our cases until we came back ,0
 I ll start off with the location was good for what we needed But It was freezing cold in the room all night I had to call to ask for extra blankets at 4am felt like I was camping outside Had to call twice and wait 25minutes to get an extra blanket The room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together There was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating The throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice Noise coming from upstairs and next door We only needed it for the night so I guess it did what I needed to do but I probably wouldn t stay there again ,0
 No phone signal in my room A bit small room even it s compact double room,0
 1 In this day age the fridge should be a standard however it was not as apparently only available in Club Rooms 2 No slippers or bathrobes either though they did provide the former on request after a little coercion 3 Lat time I had booked a Club Room but it didn t have a proper shower area hence I chose the Deluxe Double this time by checking the bathroom pics beforehand However strangely this had some other items missing like the fridge bathrobes I just don t get it how does it all balance out ,0
 The room smelled of old cigars and the air conditioner blew cold and toxic air you over charged me for breakfast I was one person and was charged for two people,0
 Furniture in club room very tired worn Shower curtain fabric don t like this sorry and shower room very small Tiles of wet room floor cracked too Booked a double room enquired to see if I could change to twin but could only offer same bed base with 2 single mattresses so declined that When checking in was given twin room even though had asked for double to remain Central reservations not easy to deal with on this ,0
 This is not a 4 star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy 14 99 Room small they call it boutique but really it is just small The room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room No bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a 4 star hotel can afford to provide this for guests ,0
 Air conditioning left room cool even when set to 25 degrees Thin walls could hear man next door snooring,0
 we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on The matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable The second night in we were up watching TV and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work So overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great ,0
 Be aware that the sister hotel is just along the same road displaying a large Park Grand sign outside The staff are used to directing new guests to the correct hotel ,0
 There was a humming sound in the room in the nights and it was really small They start vid some reparing on out floor early in the mornings strong smell from spraypaint The toiletdoor is right by the bed Rood staff in the reception both checking in and out ,0
 I didn t like the noise came when you switched the heating on at a certain temperature I didn t like not having much off a view from window looking on to other rooms,0
 Air condition was noisy Pillows were lumpy I changed the room twice but as You were full I had to have the first room anyway The second room was cold and the shower room floor icy ,0
 Stayed in room 309 Club Room damp carpet by shower room noisy plumbing and a strange smell ,0
 The cupboard where the hairdryer was didn t open all the way around making the mirror on the inside impossible to use unless you leant across the table Not a big problem just poor design ,0
 TV could have been a little bigger,0
 Breakfast hall was located in basement restaurant so bit akward to find initially,0
 room was cold the heating was not efficient despite setting the temperature to 32C room was dark only small windows overlooking a wall 2m away internet was slow not enough for Skype call ,0
 I booked a double room but it turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together We found it very uncomfortable Also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start Breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better The sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet It made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table I reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it I really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this It s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle ,0
 I can t say anything bad ,0
 Rooms are very small Not a lot of space even in the deluxe Double mirror is far from Plug so Could not Straighten my hair Shower door did not close properly Too expensive,0
 The room was quite small and the view was quite bad but okay as we only stayed for a night,0
 To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful ,0
 Everything was suburb I would consider myself a regular at the hotel and every time I go it is always great service,0
 The gym was good but I would have appreciated a yoga mat pilates ball and some more weights,0
 Bathroom was teeny tiny but very functional clean so not really a didn t like more an observation,0
 Poor Wi Fi connection We missed a cosy lounge There was no where to hang our winter coats in the room Bathroom had not enough room for our toiletries and no toilet brush For a Dane the bread at breakfast was not satisfactory only white and dry ,0
 the bathroom was a mess 4 star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement ,0
 Smallest room I ve seen in a long time I booked a double deluxe room and it appeared to be one of the smallest rooms looking at the fire escape floor plan Far from impressed ,0
 Our room was in some sort of basement therefore the view was rather disappointing The window showed some kind of patio where the hotel staff walked through to get to the other rooms We had to keep the curtains closed for privacy this was not a really big issue ,0
 So called deluxe double room is claustrophobic It is overpriced but what isn t in London In addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not ,0
 I was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take 10 days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip Also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny I wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area,0
 Rooms are much smaller than they look in website Booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc Two calls to reception with 20 min wait to get things sorted ,0
 A bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better The hotel was further from Paddington than we d expected,0
 Unfortunately the room was too hot to sleep and the air conditioning could not cope with the heat ,0
 There are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of Queens Gardens,0
 Room too small with tiniest bathroom Very lengthy check in procedure which involved taking photocopies of my id and credit card For security and other reasons I was not happy about this and it doesn t happen at other hotels ,0
 Bit strange being asked for photo ID to check in I hadn t seen that when booking and just by luck I had my driving licence with me ,0
 Room very nice but unfortunately the bed was quite dirty I know this is not the standard of this hotel but I had this unpleasant surprise on my last staying I m sure it won t happen again ,0
 No milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later ,0
 Breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time Also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel,0
 The only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows First the pillows are like bricks I recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them Also the beds are not too comfy could be better I didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade But overall for the price I paid which was 153 it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for 2 You can pay a lot more in London for the same service ,0
 This particular hotel has a chain of 3 buildings all in close proximity to each so was not sure if hotel we stayed in was one advertised Also room given to us was on ground floor and curtains covered what was the old main entrance to building no double glazing so extremely noisey,0
 There was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road This hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room Didn t sleep well Will not stay again,0
 second time i ve visited this hotel First time my husband and i were bumped This time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked Don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone You can imagine my shook and horror as 2 gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved My checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working So I froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why Oh sorry to hear that Bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff Beware of the dubious checking in policy ,0
 Disappointed that the front desk could not accept a franked letter for posting One front desk person sent me to post box at Paddington while the next day I was directed to a post box just down the street A seemingly insignificant thing but not when one is a visitor to a foreign land ,0
 We booked this through a third party booking Com Previously to that I had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday They also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion The lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party If you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price How ever I decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves I had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise On arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over When entering the junior suite room I was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room I unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise I had been let down We then went down to reception and spoke with the manager Sophia and explained our concerns of the room Sophia said I can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week I explained I wish I had been told this before How ever Sophia said I will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is Kensington park grande She spoke to reservations to find out and sort out Thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare I then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short 2 hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick We went down to reception and finally the gm Natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us ,0
 The air conditioner seems not to work because although I adjust it to 32 degrees but actually I felt less than 20 degrees and it was cold during night Also I booked for a double bed but initially it was 2 single beds next to each other Once I asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the 2 single mattresses ,0
 I was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor There was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak ,0
 Poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well Room service worst one ever Changing bed and putting same dirty pillows Come on that s not a good service for london,0
 This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day ,0
 Poor level of cleanliness in my room particularly around the bed and in the frame area of the bed Cooked breakfast was also half cold and not very good ,0
 When we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first Even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination I basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room With tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by ,0
 We were told at 9pm to keep quiet which was annoying as it was still early and then we got told we could use the club lounge and two minutes later got asked to go back to our room it was just annoying but I wouldn t say it s a place to go with a group of friends if you are planning a night out as it didn t suit us even when being quiet ,0
 Room bed was a bit worn and windows allowed some street noise in so sleeping in was not really an option,0
 N A,0
 It would have been useful to have more plug sockets in the room to charge phones etc ,0
 The size of the room was very small No cupboard to put away clothing etc There wasn t any dressing table not enough room in the bathroom to display any toiletries ,0
 Curtains as mentioned above ,0
 For the first timers the location would be confusing as there were many hotels in the same name of Park Grand in around the same location Its hard to find your way back by walking if you forget the landmarks The Bathroom is very small congested ,0
 I didnt had a bad experience,0
 Very bad and small rooms Payment sistem in hotel didn t accept visa electron card But before that when I booked room they accept ,0
 Noise from everywhere in the hotel even uf someone walk un the upper floor or flush water in toilet breakfas is not good they gave us differen building becouse we whete told there is no water in the hotel well not stat again,0
 Extra charge of 45 on leaving as they made a mistake when giving me price for room and breakfast a nice way to make extra money Noisy water pipes no ear plugs at hotel reception,0
 Air con was very noisy in the night even when switched off Could hear tv in the room next door,0
 Very compact room Dark decor made room appear smaller Location of hair dryer strange ,0
 There was a double and single bed in our room for 3 adults There were no rooms with three single beds so two of my friends had to share which was uncomfortable for them ,0
 The room was uncomfortably small When showering the water came through the bathroom door and got the carpet wet causing a bad smell,0
 Air conditioning wasn t great Where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror You had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug The mirror pulled out an angle to the bed The mattress was 2 smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time The shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room Whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark Didn t like the fact I had to hand over photo ID and the Receptionist was unable to answer why when I asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why She took my credit card to confirm I was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any ID and what if I didn t have ID would I not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room Not happy about this information being available hence why I requested the copy back on departure Small Bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages ,0
 At first the room that was given to us was not the luxury double that was booked It was a very small room But the staff kindly moved us into a bigger room and apologised for the inconvenience ,0
 The second room for our family was not as close as we would have liked despite requesting rooms together Staff were perfunctory and showed no interest whatsoever in us or in enhancing our stay in London When asked to call a taxi they arranged an Uber car and the driver did not know how to get to the destination a tube station so my husband had to use his own phone to navigate Expensive for what we got ,0
 My partner dropped a new earring in the bathroom sink and it could apparently not be retrieved without a plumber This would have cost us more than it was worth so it stayed in the u bend I believe it could have been accessed without much difficulty using a Phillips screwdriver but who carries one ,0
 The staff wasn t friendly when I was checking in She didn t even smile After that someone else was given the same room as us after we checked in Then we cannot get into our room with the key ,0
 The fact that we were transfered to another building 5 minutes away because of maintenance issues The room and bathroom are very small in size The shower box is literally the size of a single cupboard ,0
 The evening receptionist Desmond on the night of the 8th to the 9th of December handled a situation very badly when his colleagues earlier on in the day had given us permission to use the lounge room until pick up by shuttle to the airport at 4am he came to inform us that we could not stay in the hotel unless we book a room He apologized after upsetting us but it was a bit too late ,0
 Disappointed that I couldn t cancel my breakfast but was offered a take away Although I didn t have time for it I did take out an excellent coffee ,0
 I stayed twice so far each time in the standard double room Once was in an attic and that room was a lot more tight for space than the other Both fairly usually small for an inner city hotel room The Attic room lights were bright with no lamp but the other room had better mood lighting ,0
 No bottle of water was available the hotel provide the tea and coffee without water no purpose ,0
 Pretty much everything the Dulux room isn t very Dulux at all I could hardly walk around the bed that room is that small there no storage space for your bags etc they have one cupboard wide enough to fit a couple shirts it s about 5inch deep There s was stains all over the curtains and carpet The bathroom is a tiny wet room where you have no space to actually move around ,0
 Too far from City central if you didn t know you have to have an Oyster card for buses and your friend won t go on the tube No plug socket near a mirror ,0
 I didnt like the way a staff member handled my cancellation of one night as I had to cut my trip short because of a death in the family Trainees should be taught to escalate more sensitive matters if they are not equipped to handle them ,0
 triple room is small Not enough space for big luggages You have to squeeze in to fit and not enough variety of food in the breakfast lounge,0
 The first night I was booked to a tiny double bedroom 033 on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by Also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut Also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from 07 00am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on The bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but I felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good Overall I stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience,0
 Letter of complaint already written Small room with nowhere to work No shower as such just a wet room and you could not open bathroom door to get in there,0
 It s true that they give booking com customers the worst rooms right by reception The bathroom was tiny not enough plug sockets and the shower wouldn t stop dripping The room was also freezing and had to ask for a heater ,0
 The rooms are very small and also booking com is VERY misleading the room did not have all of the listed items in the room the room was spose to be a deluxe but was more like a standard very disappointing and very misleading description of the room from booking com,0
 The only thing missing was there was no bath only a shower but it was a great shower The rooms were a little too cosey small ,0
 Breakfast was disappointing would of been upset if I had to pay for it,0
 The rooms were extremely small and overpriced We asked to be moved from the first room as it was in the basement off the main corridor and what felt like a storage area Very disappointed for the price being charged The second room was an improvement however still very small ,0
 The room I was saying was directly under the stairs and I could hear every footstep I didn t sleep very well as there was a constant disturbance I would suggest insulating that particular room to prevent the noise thudding through ,0
 at my arrival I didn t find the room even if the late arrival was written they just offer me a taxi for another hotel but I had to look for it they didn t suggest me anything ,0
 The rooms are very very small we only had 2 small suitcases and there was no room for them The breakfast isn t great we were given it complementary but would have been very disappointed if I d paid for it ,0
 absolutely noisy air condition they booked a deposit of one night that has not been resolved again upon payment mini bathroom not possible to shower without getting everything wet no wardrobe at all,0
 Dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear They need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings They will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up Happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved Really bad experience won t be booking again They also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club ,0
 Stairs our room is located between the ground and the 1st floor so no direct lift access We had to carry our big suitcases from stairs Gladly the hotel staffs were really helpful with our luggages The room was a bit narrow but perfectly acceptable given the price and being in London ,0
 No thing good on this hotel Very small rooms we booked for room 14 m2 it was less of 8 m2 This not hotel but like one store of animals ,0
 Small Very small room ,0
 We felt the location was a bit far out from the main attractions however the price of the room was very reasonable which compensated for the taxi fares ,0
 not hotels fault but noise from idiots driving around cars middle of night with loud car exhausts,0
 That their system couldn t heat the room and I had to use a heater ,0
 The double room I was in was extremely small The bathroom was as well There is no possible way that more than one person could possibly stay in that room Now I was there for business and I literally just slept showered and dressed there so there was no real issue but just understand what you are getting ,0
 Everything were good only the bathroom is to small and the shower water doesn t go to the drainage straight away so it is wet everywhere and the cupboard is not functional hard to reach ,0
 I did not the like the reception staff as when there was a problem the resented the fact that there was one ,0
 Bathing cubicle does not have sliding door Hence we had to request for extra floor mat to prevent flooding ,0
 The rooms were small and the bathroom was a wet room which wasn t great especially as it was unexpected Also not entirely sure we were given the deluxe double room we paid for ,0
 Uuufhh Where do I even start The rooms have no space you feel confined in them You can hear the person next door through the walls The hotel is a long walk from the nearest station The housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came 4 times between 11 and 12 noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though I told her not come in again The hotel should be 2 star and I don t know how they were rated 4 star Perhaps it is self acclaimed I wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t A word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words ,0
 Look at the curtains looks like blood stains all over even though it may be chemicals I hope Also you pulled money ahead of time which I wasnt informed of as it stood that the full amount would be paid at the property ,0
 The first night we were allocated a basement room found this claustrophobic The staff who were excellent throughout moved us on the second night to a much better room on level3,0
 Lovely bedroom but no space to walk round my bed ,0
 Steps leading from pavement to Reception were awkward for a pushchair Price of the breakfast Lots of cafes within 5 minutes walking distance charging only 5 6 for a full English breakfast ,0
 Room was not as described it was tiny in basement looked out to old ladders dirty curtains Shower flooded floor soaking hazardous wet all round wc and whb this was not a deluxe room Diningroom very pokey claustrophobic,0
 The room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting It looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so I had to keep the curtains closed more gloom I assume I was given the room because I was travelling alone but I booked for 2 people and I was paying the same as 2 people I don t appreciate being treated as a 2nd class citizen ,0
 May be the Restaurant Bar must extend the close hours ,0
 The double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and I felt like I was in a prison cell when I complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however I did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have 2 single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay 50 more for 2 nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it 2 single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is ,0
 Got to the hotel we booked and needed to be moved elsewhere We were not happy with the hotel we were moved to as a group and this review reflects that hotel the Montcalm ,0
 The location is far away in terms of walking to marble arch oxford and regent street There is a hotel almost have the same name with one word different in the end of the road which makes the taxis some times lost and confused Not enough electric socket and not close to bed for phone charging The room is too small comparing to other hotels with the same class Not recommended to families due to small rooms Check there official website before book via booking com as some times you will find it cheaper and comes with breakfast ,0
 We had a problem at reception when we arrived which was never resolved to our satisfaction ,0
 Room was tiny marginally bigger than the bed and more importantly there was no where to put anything be it my bag or even just a hair brush The bathroom is what is euphemistically known as a wet room meaning everything gets soaked when you have a shower You therefore have to plan your morning routine carefully unless you don t mind cleaning your teeth while standing in a puddle ,0
 The bathroom If it can be called that even Honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower We had to put down 3 towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room It was really very tiny though we were in the Club Room ,0
 I didn t like that it took 2 other bad experiences in Paddington before we found this one ,0
 I was setting in the Reception Reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at 2 clock you can get the key and other giving them the key When I spoke to her she said we have categories I told her I know you have categories when first customer came I kept quite because they are 2 but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait 15 min it will reach 2 and you will get the key after 5 min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster The reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses My evidence hotel camera ,0
 An unpleasant smell in bathrooms due to style of plumbing and in some rooms wet room means that bathroom floor can be rather wet ,0
 Very big problems with payment by bank transfer Problems with extension our stay at hotel Shame because hotel is ok ,0
 The wardrobe and the hair dryer were a slightly inconvenient to use But it s manageable for a few days stay ,0
 Incorrect payment my credit card was charged twice first time on the arrival send time when we leave When I found this I tried to get my money back It is already almost 20 days 5 emails written and still did not get my money back Never go there again ,0
 got a basement room with no natural light Tiny room tiny wadrobe inside a wall and they could do smth with unused space from the entrance to the room ,0
 The size of a double deluxe room was small and I had rather claustrophobic impression No fulfilment of my preliminary request The bathroom floor gets totally flooded One chair only in a double room The same foods served in breakfast evryday and poor choice ,0
 Toilet seat had hair on it the two rooms were not very close together and they were rather cramped ,0
 The room was tiny To put this into perspective we are two 30 yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury I ve also been in London a number of times so I understand hotel rooms are small in general Knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it We actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room ,0
 We had to change rooms as the ac did not work and they did not fix it Staff could hardly understand English and I thought I was in London but English is not the language ,0
 Reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful I feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only 9 not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual London cabs etc We booked a room for 3 people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa Also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them I wouldn t trust them again with my credit card ,0
 Wish the rooms were a bit bigger We booked a triple room They gave us the one facing the back of the hotel which was very claustrophobic It was so bad we were going to leave the hotel but then they showed us their other triple room which faces the front street of the hotel and that was much better But generally very claustrophobic rooms My teenage kids didn t like it as they need their space ,0
 The room was too small bathroom sink was clogged and electrical sockets did not work so I could not charge by mobile phone I changed my hotel to Grand Park Court around the block ,0
 TINY room and I mean tiny Literally just enough room for a bed Lipstick on wine glasses 4 days in a row so not cleaned properly air con has one setting only Arctic and loud ,0
 Terrible Gym Kitchen people smoking right outside this tiny Gym with windows open into gym and terrible smell of cigarette Very expensive for what you get and also not on par with other 4 stars ,0
 had to ask for complimentary items that should have been included in our room hairdryer situation was poor couldn t see in a mirror without being a contortionist no explanation of facilities and their location,0
 Extremely small rooms though not surprising for Central London you can barely move within the ground floor rooms Either misleading pictures on booking com or the hotel gave us their smallest rooms knowing we re travelling with children ,0
 1 The steep steps leading to my room 2 THe lack of a cloth to cover the bread stick as you cut it thus your hand and anyonelses was placed on the end of the bread to steady it as you cut ,0
 Upon check in I was asked to move to a sister property Apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size They miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small Incredibly dirty I will not be back I checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee I will not be back ,0
 They changed us two times from one hotel to another when we arrived They offered us complimentary breakfast The drawback is that the bathroom was very small and it smells bad sometimes ,0
 Deluxe double was a small room Interior was back to the 70s TV was small and hardly viewable Front line staff were great but the managers appeared as honest as Arthur Daley No room for luggage Bathroom too small,0
 Reception was a nightmare When we arrived they put into a room which NOT what we ordered and they were more concerned with taking our money than providing a service Treated us like B grade guests because we had booked using Booking com We asked them to book a taxi for us on departure and they booked a cab for the wrong time Would not stay there again ,0
 The room and bathroom shower was very small and quite claustrophobic ,0
 rooms are slightly small so if you have a big luggage hard to move and no space to unpack some of the stuff had an attitude i had a big window in the room but looking to back side of the street so no nice view ,0
 The room was a Club It was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed Anyone more than 6ft 3 tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height The bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room The mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable 2 nights sleep Overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth As a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere ,0
 We had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view Then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose The room was smaller than we expected to get for the 436 we paid for the two nights Also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded All in all definitely not worth the money we paid ,0
 Unfortunately there was not enough storage space in our room One small hanging space and two small bedside drawers is not enough for a stay of three nights It meant that we were not even able to partially unpack our cases I would have liked more space for our personal toiletries in the bathroom as well ,0
 NOT the room type we ordered and paid for Two very single mattress made up individually on a king size wooden bed base does not equal a double bed Room was nice but not in our opinion a deluxe ,0
 Rooms are too small not enough or to be correct almost no wardrobe space and a useless entry space without even a few hooks that area could be used at least to hang your coat hat or a few stuff,0
 A room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests Neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name This lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting Instead it was sent back by the receptionist ,0
 Despite 21 days ill health notice the hotel would not consider changing our reservation to another date and our full nights accommodation was forfeited,0
 The rooms provided were small We had to upgrade for the bigger rooms Credit card details provided at time of booking via booking com was debited even though payment for the ris were made upfront This was only refunded after 96 hours blocking credit unnecessarily ,0
 Small room and the slow inprofessional response from the staff for the room A c problem despite complaining three times about it which took them two nights to move me for another room with a properly working A C unit ,0
 The toilet was very small On the day we checked in the walk in price was less than what we paid on booking com I would definitely call the hotel to check the price before booking ,0
 The room was awful Too small very claustrophobic awful view,0
 Rooms were not as advertised Although clean and well maintained rooms were a bit run down Rooms were very small for the price Hardly room to dwing a cat Management were not responsive to requests for change Had the feeling of being conned ,0
 Rooms not facing street look to back alley and backs of old buildings One of our rooms had funky location down steps off the main hallway Very small bathroom ,0
 We had arranged to have a continental breakfast my husband changed his mind When checking out the manager charged us the difference for 3 people having a full English breakfast When challenged and asked for a receipt the manager rudely passed threw the receipt to my husband My husband asked he why he did it and was ignored A sad ending to an otherwise very enjoyable stay ,0
 The size of the room is definitely smaller than the description Befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk We rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable I think it is because of overbook The hotel is not very clean And at the 7th day the toilet flush button also didn t work well ,0
 The room we had was in basement so no phone signal which was a pain,0
 The walk in shower as the floor was always flooded ,0
 There was absolutely no insolation between the room and corridor I was woken constantly through the night especially with people coming back in the early hours of the morning and arguing for several hours I travel extensively and this is the worst hotel I ve stayed at due to the noise factor ,0
 The experience was very bad staff unprofessional especially the reception Bad Bad Bad room service This hotel dont deserve to be 4 stars at all max 2 5 stars ,0
 The bathroom was ridiculous There was no tub or shower door just a curtain and a drain in the middle of the floor so when you showered water soaked the entire bathroom floor surface ,0
 Initially we were provided with two very poor rooms Neither had curtains only blinds which did not close properly The compact room was extremely small and had a musty smell The deluxe double could in no way be described as deluxe Among other things the carpet at the entrance of the shower room was very wet ,0
 The rooms were incredibly small and cramped We struggled to even get through the door to our room The rooms were not clean there were very big brown stains on the carpet The hotel is dated and the fixtures including the thermostat were falling off the wall in some cases ,0
 The water didn t drain well The desk staff were sour faced do they not enjoy their job ,0
 The wet room,0
 We would recommend a local area map with facilities in walking distance,0

 The room is so small and it had lots of dust The door cannot lock I also requested for the upper storey room But I got a basement room ,0
 The extra bed in the room,0
 Not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is OK but they also noted down the CVV number from the back of the credit card This means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases Since this is unacceptable I asked the receptionist to delete the CVV but she refused This policy should be changed Otherwise good hotel ,0
 N A,0
 The sauna is a wonderfull addition it s a shame I had to slalom in the cleaning staff halway almost filled with cleaning products Also the proximity to the cleaning staff s room added all the noise to what was supposed to be a quiet moment maybe it would be a good idea to relocate their general quarter ,0
 They have maintenance and I couldn t enjoy the balcony view ,0
 Reception not impressive building was under construction Room passage was way to small Room has also no space,0
 lift wasn t working to 6th floor as under maintenance room service dinners aren t the greatest ,0
 I didn t liked that SPA and massage rooms were under maintenance Breakfast was a bit overpriced 20euro per person just for a breakfast just outside there are few restourants that had main course and dessert for same price ,0
 No gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom Also I was not allowed to then change hotel after I discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short I was then emailed far to late saying I could change but by that time I was already at work Also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too Absolute joke how you can get away with that ,0
 the rooms are small but hey it s Paris,0
 Due to the tightness of parking you re requested to leave car keys with reception so they can move cars if necessary I was blocked in as the owners didn t leave their car key though the manager did manage to get round this The sound proofing wasn t great as I could hear the people above me talking non stop from 7am ,0
 Could improve on breakfast items grapefruit juice was not fresh anymore scrambled eggs not enough cooked ,0
 Room was small as only slightly larger than bed Themed rooms with photos of American icons was strange for being in Paris Costly to be expected in Paris though ,0
 Very small room for the price they charge ,0
 Breakfast was expensive so I didn t take it ,0
 Room size,0
 Busy area meant loud mornings outside ,0
 room is small price is too high compare with the equipment and service for the room i booked ,0
 room dimension,0
 Wifi was very poor ,0
 expensive breakfast,0
 Location not far from Gard de Nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the Metro which was good Breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot Bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere D cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better Ice Bar was a great novelty but at 18C we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it Also a kettle in the room would be helpful ,0
 The showers in the rooms are awful not enclosed with just a tap extension on the wall which is too low and the water sprays everywhere,0
 The location wasn t the best but it was real close to the metro which got you anywhere you wanted in minutes So it wasn t so bad ,0
 Limited food available from the reception bar ,0
 Booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t The TV didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work Advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution Acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to Eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and I should just make do Very sub standard,0
 Worst hotel ever Awful location bar and restaurant closed all 3 days we were there Non existent receptionists and TV reception was variable Had junior suite but no robes no proper shower either ,0
 No proper light over bathroom mirror Bathroom open to room Nightclub feel to corridors Floor in foyer worn and didn t appear clean breakfast was set up there and with the black decor was not very inviting we took our breakfast out into the courtyard The breakfast buffet was okay but the cheese was in a container which had previously been used for a fish buffet a whiff of old seafood at breakfast The corridors walls were covered with a black fake fur ,0
 I didn t feel very comfortable around the area and the fact you could hear people outside the room most of the night as well was not the best ,0
 Very bad experience as I lost more than 700 euros It was stolen from my bag I just knew when I arrived back ,0
 Toilet not clean on arrival no shower curtain shower fixture loose bad smell in room ,0
 very bad area in the station neighborhood staff couldn t speak English so it was extremely difficult to communicate lack of communication among staff which forced me to repeat things to each member of staff it took me 1 hr to check out ,0
 We didn t have a bad experience but the location seems a little unsafe at night WLking in the day is fine but I would be more inclined to take a taxi at night There were a lot of youths and homeless out drinking This is unfortunately out of the hands of the hotel ,0
 Fitness club was out of order which was the only reason I booked this particular hotel for the price The staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our 5 day stay And there are no parks nearby for running There were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet There was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week ,0
 the noise and the neighbourhood,0
 First day cold water and no breakfast Localization very bad on a dangerous zone ,0
 Gym,0
 very bad location very shabby area staff did not speak good English so very difficult to communicate,0
 Hotel closing for refurbishment Most of the staff being sacked Future of the hotel likely to be expensive with new staff They are losing their best asset ,0
 Some of the ground floor spaces needed a facelift which they are now undergoing ,0
 Hotel facade works ,0
 The bedrooms are very tired and a bit grubby looking Air con and extractor were broken ,0
 hotel not up to scratch in certain areas It will close for refurbishment shortly so hopefully it will sort a few problems out ,0
 Under going renovation which I wasn t made aware of room comfortable but tired ,0
 Place is really old cramped and dirty even dirtier than London in general There was a smell in the room I was initially put into and another smell in another room I asked for ,0
 1 The hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized 2 It was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience 3 The in room breakfast was not on time I was almost late on the morning 4 Very old decorations not clean enough 5 It was definitely not worth for the price ,0
 Noise from the air conditioning units We may not be able to afford a room once the improvements are completed,0
 We had no complaints whatsoever ,0
 Double room was small and in need of a freshen up Also woken up a 5am when a noisy generator fired up outside our room this may have something to do with all the building work that is going on at the hotel but when you have had a late night that s the last thing you want ,0
 Sink in bathroom extremely small We were asked for our champagne to room and didnt appear so had to get on check out Also found it very disappointing to be asked to pay for room service on the spot and not able to put on room bill we were very offended by this we have stayed in hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this before In fact had returned from a wonderful holiday in Hong Kong just the week before and had room service and paid on check out Would appreciate some feed back on this matter,0
 I have stayed at the hotel at least half a dozen times over the past three years The rooms are getting tired and worn The front desk staff are indifferent I tried to break a 50 note at front desk so I could tip the waitress in dining room at breakfast they told me to do it myself at one of the nearby restaurants Major exterior renos going on outside hotel I hope they are going to upgrade the rooms as well I think it is time that I try another hotel ,0
 Light outside of the door shines through spy hole and the door frame Unable to turn it off crazy I am a returning client make more of your existing client base ,0
 Had to go to local shop for fresh milk as not available from housekeeping staff One awful sandwich in the bar Shame really as other food very good ,0
 The first room we were allocated had a musty smell to it but we were efficiently moved across to another room with no bother at all Some areas need updating but this was already underway in some parts of the hotel Shower was very noisy ,0
 I had requested a quiet room Given room on the 6th floor air conditioning not cooling room but extremely noisy room very hot Blocked bath drain shower faulty water filling the bath from the bath tap while shower on Requested room change Given Room on 2nd floor Windows blocked out no daylight Extreme noise from continual external exhaust fans between 5am until 11pm Worst sleep ever Old noisy air conditioning system also Hotel undergoing major building works not advised of this When booking I booked for 3 nights and wanted to cancel the last night to go elsewhere but hotel unable to advise about cancellation as I had made the booking through Booking com ,0
 The bed was huge plenty of room but the mattress was extremely hard and slightly bowed Both my husband I had an uncomfortable nights sleep woke in the morning with aching backs which was a first for both of us ,0
 see adjacent box ,0
 The room was a bit small but that s a function of the hotel maintaining the Victorian style we liked Work on the hotel was in progress while we were there so the machine sounds in the lobby were deafening at times ,0
 Room and hotel generally were a little dark Pillow was lumpy Decor and furniture a little tired ,0
 Seems like room would be very hot in summer Air conditioning did not cool room very much when I used it but not a real issue in June ,0
 The rooms are dingy and in serious need of an upgrade with chipped furniture and old fittings ,0
 The hotel was being renovated which gave it a slightly run down appearance The sink in our room was cracked and there was no hair conditioner available in the hotel The television was very small and dated ,0
 N A,0
 We had a small claustrophobic room next to the noisy road with a questionable air con system and the shower did not work An engineer failed to repair it and after several cold showers we were moved to a new quieter and better room the next day and were compensated for the inconvenience ,0
 Shower was a bit different to work taps slightly broken and the tap you pull up was broken ,0
 We chose that hotel because of its locations but the room was an interior one and the view was awful which was very disappointing Interior rooms shouldn t cost the same money The Windows weren t closing and some parts need refurbishment ,0
 After checking out I left my luggage at the concierge However when I returned I had to wait or over 20 minutes before I got my items as the concierge was elsewhere This resulted in me nearly missing my train ,0
 Hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses The tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it Breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid I d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge ,0
 There was no water in the room and we had to pay 10 for two bottles from the bar ,0
 We couldn t shower bath the cold tap fell off bathroom very cramped would be better off with just a shower in there Breakfast was awful dried up bacon mushrooms eggs weren t any better Drinks very expensive We did complain and were given a refund,0
 The air conditioning was pretty useless and didn t cool down the room as it was located on the floor and not on the ceiling and it was very warm in the room ,0
 They charge a fortune for breakfast use the caf s surrounding the park instead Cheaper and nicer For working not very good comfort The desk and chair in the room is very uncomfortable to sit and work with ,0
 Rooms and bathrooms larger and better air conditioning ,0
 Breakfast was horribly overpriced We were offered option for reduced rate of we bought breakfast every morn of our visit but we couldn t do this because we had to leave early the day we departed ,0
 The fire drill that takes place every Monday at 1 00 pm After a transatlantic flight we were asleep when the alarm went off ,0
 The bed was extremely uncomfortable The mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it I woke up with back pains as well We ended up switching hotels because of it There was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer Other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that Personally that didn t really bother me ,0
 Not unique to The Russell but I dislike being charged a discretionary service charge of 12 5 and also asked to leave a gratuity on the bill ,0
 Rooms very tired and badly in need of refurbishment Air conditioning did not work Bathroom very small Lifts very small ,0
 The shower didn t work properly The bathroom was tiny and it wasn t easy to get out of the shower A shower cap would have come in useful ,0
 I loved this place They are renovating some of the hotel and so it will be even nicer ,0
 Hotel is very tired We had a twin bedded room which faced an interior courtyard Windows very dirty outside Tiles in the bathroom needed grouting Room service extremely limited ,0
 The shower leaked under the door into the bedroom and the bathroom floor was also very slippery The bedroom was far too hot and couldn t be cooled down ,0
 My room was on the Road side of the building Extremely noisy with ambulances racing down the road Dining room not open when on one night I stayed I was not informed of this on checking in ,0
 Some of us found the frequent sirens of ambulances heading for the nearby Great Ormond Street Hospital disturbing in the nighttime ,0
 No shower cap shower gel or conditioner Insufficient milk and coffee Air conditioning so noisy that it was unusable Fridge not working Food in restaurant very average quality Drinks very expensive Threadbare carpet on stairs ,0
 Friendly concierges were helpful but weren t actually familiar with many of the sites or transports inquired after They went online to find out ,0
 Building is old and has a very small lift however great staircase ,0
 More choice for room service both food and drink to suit todays traveller More TV film choices as currently limited ,0
 The Hotel Russell is one of our favourite London hotels but our room this visit was quite small and there was no view at all from the window BUT it was very good value we booked quite late and it was a busy weekend ,0
 Got a room over the hallway from major refurbishment that woke us up in the morning Got the room changed with very little fuss ,0
 the pillow too big for me therefore my nights were uncomfotable i was obliged to use the red decorative cushion ,0
 It s a tired old building We had problems with plumbing A C didn t work elevator is so tiny two people plus luggage fill it up Windows didn t open There is no business center to print airline tickets Overall it was expensive and there are other choices nearby at the same or lower cost ,0
 We spend 5 nights in three different rooms We were moved twice due to very very poor Quality rooms This is a lovely looking hotel from the street with marvellous staff and a great position but a hotel that is well over due for a complete makeover I would suggest for the price to stay at the Russell you could do MUCH better elsewhere,0
 The room 427 was not up to the standards of a 2016 4 star hotel Mattress too hard Not enough wardrobe space noisy Bathroom would have been ok in 1975 ,0
 Air conditioning unit didn t work and it was a hot night on Saturday with quite thick duvets on the bed Also the bathroom was VERY compact Quite a tight squeeze to get to the sink and mirror ,0
 I m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot The sink in the bathroom was very small Being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and I was awakened early It was very hot in London this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times I was also unhappy that I d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when I returned on Sunday evening that money had disappeared I know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken Another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either ,0
 I wonder why we could not choose the table when we had a breakfast Is it separated by race or rank of room we are Japanese I hope not This is the first hotel which the staves designated our table And the tables we were shown were not so comfortable Besides I would like to request to improve the breakfast And about our room honestly I regreted not asking to change another room I wanted have stayed my mother at the room which is better lighted and better view even if I paid extra fee because it was my mother s last 3 days of staying in London ,0
 Needs a bit of TLC but overall a very nice hotel Noisy aircon generators outside the room View was actually of them but it is London and we paid around 169 for just bed no breakfast which in London is reasonable ,0
 The room was tatty and well worn with gaps in the fitting of the windows and a really very poor standard of maintenance ,0
 The room I booked was for my partners birthday surprise and was nice but a little small The package I booked was rose petals and bottle of bubbles on arrival which was lovely The one on the website was a lot larger or an excellent camera shoot Luckily I don t get up in the night but if I had of the space between the wall and the bed would of been interesting as very tight ,0
 1st room too noisy opposite 2 pubs 2nd room plumbing problem no refrigerator 3rd room wifi signal too weak in room no refrigerator ,0
 The rooms on the 5th floor are very small and unless your 5ft 9 you ll have to squat to get underneath the shower head ,0
 Small small room First room air did not work However they did change our room the next day,0
 Happy with everything,0
 More shelf room needed in the bathroom was my only critism ,0
 Room sheets could ve been cleaner ,0
 Building work during the day but this can t be helped ,0
 2nd floor noise from street level but I can deal with that Bed is uncomfortable Old spring Not a good night sleep as a result Shower pressure was not great Overall the particular room we had could be the exception ,0
 Drilling started VERY early in the daytime for the ongoing refurbishment,0
 I was advised that the restaurant was closed on Sundays which was a pity as the friend I was meeting and I would have liked to eat there The only thing missing was a bathrobe I d have enjoyed a bathrobe subsequent hotels during my trip all had them but the hotels themselves weren t as good ,0
 How to get cold water in the bathroom is and remains a mystery Breakfast variety of fruits and kinds of breads is limited ,0
 Horrible mattresses sprung chairs pathetic bathroom supplies staff were grumpy and poorly trained Interiors are depressing ,0
 The value rating vs money that you get cannot be acceptable for a 4star hotel We were given a room for a single that the adjective tiny does not represent how small it was transformed to get a couple In a 4 star hotel that is far from acceptable After complaining twice since the first time they got us another tiny room we finally got the expected room The images of the hotel s rooms are far from being the real deal A disappointing experience ,0
 Never got washcloths ,0
 2nd bed in our double accommodation was a sleeper sofa and the mattress was sheer torture ,0
 Check in was terrible we arrived about 6 pm and it took us 2 5 hours to get the room ,0
 Quite some noise came from machinery in the courtyard through closed windows even at night ,0
 Room service menu is a little limited Having said that there are numerous eateries on your doorstep Parking not on site but close by ,0
 Bar prices a bit steep but did sort of expect it being such a classy hotel,0
 Not enough towel hooks for two people Nowhere to place tooth brush and toiletries near sink ,0
 The building is old and the decor shabby What you see on the booking site isn t the room you get Our room was small carpet worn Windows filthy and a tiny bath with a tiny TV ,0
 Could have done without a visit from a man to check the blinds once we d checked in The roman blind didn t work very well Room was slightly smaller than one would expect for the money and a little tired ,0
 Room rather hot airless Window with obscured glass into internal courtyard didn t open aircon not very effective Only one set of shampoo soap etc ,0
 Epensive unless you get a special fare,0
 Bathroom a little small 628 but they are updating rooms Shower did not work properly Kept going hot and cold It may have had something to do with the workmen next door But we managed ,0
 The biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of English and this was hugely frustrating Not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too It was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and I do think the language barrier plays a big part in this For this reason alone I sadly will not be coming back ,0
 The rooms are in the process of being refurbished but there were holes in the carpet in my room ,0
 The prices in the bar were very high The dinner menu was mainly just pub food The long walk to the bedroom from the elevator ,0
 Very small bathroom a larger person would not be able to get to the sink given the proximity to the shower screen on the bath ,0
 The room on level 3 was above air conditioning units so sleep was not do great as we had to have the window open because it was very hot in the room We was moved to this room after we refused the other room on level 2 because the windows did not open,0
 It was all good Our family room which I booked was unavailable so the manager gave us two separate rooms and complimentary breakfast Customer service was first class,0
 the room was quite small and the windows not insulated so outside noise and cold air were factors,0
 On arrival the doorman asked if I could get out my wheelchair and climb the stairs as the lift would take too long for him to set up ,0
 View of an inside courtyard Room virtually furthest from entrance good exercise For the price and given the lead time booking I expected a view of London breakfast way below par for a hotel of this stature Book in took all of 15 minutes as staff struggled to find us a room despite a 4 month lead time,0
 We would return to the room after a day out on the city and housekeeping would not have cleaned our room yet at 5 00 in the afternoon and we d have to leave for 30 minute once housekeeping finally came by ,0
 My husband was accused of smoking in room he hadnt thy put a letter under our door and took 200 out of my account without permission 4 conversations later they reumbersed monies but it ruined it for me as i was very upset about it They made us feel like criminals and didnt give us a chance to defend ourselves our friend who we met whilst in London is a barrister and was appalled when we told him ,0
 My room was cancelled a few days before and I was given a room with a poor view but what made it worse was the fact the windows were dreadfully dirty and it was only the second floor made the room grubby Also the step into the bath was extremely high ,0
 Check in was frustrating our room had been allocated to someone else which we found out when we tried to access the room Rooms were generally small and not clean to the standard expected for a 4 hotel In general I felt we paid more than we should have for what we got ,0
 Bedroom needed redecorating poor storage facilities Bath very small Noise from workmen along corridor Early morning deliveries below window,0
 Unfortunately I got a room next to the kitchen extractor fan which was VERY noisy Room 247 by the way The first night it stopped at 11 p m so that was all right but the second night it did not so I hardly slept at all However when I mentioned this at checking out I was compensated with having my breakfasts taken off the bill and promised a free upgrade next time I come so I ended up feeling more pleased than I had thought I would be I have stayed at the Russell several times before After my sleepless night I thought this was the last time but because of the way my complaint was dealt with I will certainly return ,0
 Uncomfortable bed small room windows requiring repair and were drafty and noisy and the room decor was extremely dated ,0
 the extractor fan in our room didn t work the window in our room didn t open and as the room was small the poor ventilation was an issue especially when the shower was on also there were no extra sockets so charging our phones etc was difficult We moved to a different room on the 3rd night of a 3 night stay so at least the last night was better but 1st and 2nd nights were disappointing ,0
 Tired room with peeling wallpaper stained furniture cracks all over the room The duvet was lumpy however they fixed this right away The iron didn t work very well Extremely cramped toilet as in the sink fitted just over the toilet seat had to be a contortionist to use it however it was clean ,0
 We had booked superior rooms but they were unavailable however the hotel gave complimentary breakfast and bottle of wine ,0
 Would have liked bigger room and one with a view but you don t go to London to sit in your room Breakfast good but a little expensive ,0
 didn t like being woken up an hour before needing to be woken up especially at 3 30am,0
 Despite the grand public spaces the rooms are rather tired in terms of d cor and furnishings and really need to be torn apart and modernized The windows are grubby and haven t been cleaned in years After coming from a four star hotel in Valencia that was exquisite in every respect I realized I had returned to shabby Britain ,0
 Automatic 12 5 tip added to everything Why do companies do this It gets right up my nose Leaves you feeling either ripped off or nowty for asking for it to be removed Such a shame Would have been 11 out of 10 otherwise ,0
 The Saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual The air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside The bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person I really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep ,0
 Room was very tired feeling walls and skirting needed a good sand down and coat of paint Rust damage down back of hand basin clearly visible from toilet ,0
 The bedrooms are tiny but saying that we weren t in the rooms a lot ,0
 Front desk receptionist was extremely rude Programmed my key card incorrectly my room was in a far corner of the hotel 4 long corridors I dragged my suitcase and backpack there back and forth twice until they were able to get it right She didn t apologize mostly shrugged and said sometimes it s sensitive Stands out as bad service ,0
 When I arrived at 10 30pm the double room I had booked 129 was not available had been double booked and I was offered a single 129 with a so called free breakfast even though I knew the breakfast was normally 19 so they were actually ripping me off Eventually they agreed 109 with a free breakfast the room itself though was incredibly small so much so I had to move the cahir in front of the door to be able to see the to feom the bed,0
 The building is old and there was a lot of noise from banging doors other residents I guess ,0
 Was impossible to store extracted breastmilk in the freezer due to hotel policy I could use the fridge at reception but I would have booked a different hotel if I knew this beforehand Aircon was quite noisy windows were dirty ,0
 Room rather gloomy due to limited light and external low level noise assume to be some kind of extraction units Extra milk would have be helpful ,0
 The rooms were to small and everything crammed in The overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed Bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work There was excessive noise from outside I e The kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about 5 which is ridiculous The air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it The TV remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the TV unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn TV off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise ,0
 Extract fan outside the window droned on and on all day and all night aggravating tinnitus ,0
 Have stayed here several time in very nice rooms but this time the room was very tired with watermarks on the ceiling from a leak The shower leaked so much that there was no pressure I was moved to an equally tired room across the corridor but at least the shower worked I was obviously in the budget area but not at a budget price ,0
 The first room a twin room facing the court yard was awful noisy air con and windows could not open Unable to sleep But we got another room which was very nice We dont really eat breakfast and it was a little annoying that the reception lept trying to make us book breakfast ,0
 The room was a bit small and warm as only 1 window of the 3 could be opened for only 3 inches Our room was on the side of the hotel and the morning sun makes the room so hot Bathroom was a bit disappointing Small very tine sink next to bath like u have in your house in a downstairs toilet your elbow touches the wall when brushing teeth or cleaning face shower head is the old fashioned the one attached to the wall so you cant take the head down ,0
 Room didn t face on to Russell Square but was quite noisy Windows did little to cut out minimise noise Fellow guests were also quite noisy walls doors were quite thin and noise filtered in ,0
 Size of room,0
 There wasn t anything to not like,0
 Hotel interior is looking a little tired and could do with a minor make over the rooms are very clean so don t be put off ,0
 Noise in room was awful toilet was stuck to the side of wash hand basin making it difficult to use very small bathroom windows need replacing urgently this will help with noise I was surprised at breakfast to find only mugs on the table no saucers no table covers tea and toast would be nice if brought to table herb sausages at breakfast scrambled eggs need to be kept hotter as with most of the buffet breakfast was lukewarm ,0
 Disabled wet room Was not informed about this during check in,0
 the rooms are not so good the first night I stayed on the 5th floor the room was unconfortably cold as the roof is not insulated and the windows are very old and draughty Only lukewarm water in the shower in the morning The second night I moved to the third floor the room was larger and nicer but again the windows were draughty and single glazed and the sink in the bathroom was ridiculously small ,0
 Window needed to be washed but not much of a view on the backside of the building anyway ,0
 Can not think of anything ,0
 shower was over the bath and it was high to get into A walk in shower is preferable for me however it didn t spoil our wonderful stay ,0
 the shower in the bathroom is not detachable and every time had to wet my hair ,0
 I had a double room at the back of the hotel which was a bit noisey due to air conditioner units the room should of had a fridge and being a double room should of had two of everything in the bathroom which it did not ,0
 Room wasn t available until 1 5 hours after check in time Bathroom too small we expected a little more from a four star hotel ,0
 I can t think of anything ,0
 Refreshments in the bedroom were very poor for a hotel of this calibre Wallpaper loose on ceiling All rooms should be in excellent condition,0
 Shower went hot and cold and noise from other rooms annoying I know its central London and the traffic noise doesn t bother me but someone throwing up in the next room that sounds like its right by your head is not so good ,0
 Could have done with a hook next to the shower to hang your towel on ,0
 The room is far away too small than we though and the picture shows the facility is old in the room the sink and drainage hole of bathtub broken and worse We change the room more than one time Enduring the rest of our staying ,0
 Despite being on the 7th floor we couldn t believe how noisy our room was from the traffic in the street below Single glazed very old windows that really need replaced though a good wash would be a start Bed was NOT comfy The room was small but clean I think these rooms are for booking com customers you get what you pay for i guess ,0
 room was small but no complaints given the price that s London unless you pay top dollar ,0
 the toilet was stinking pretty bad normal rooms were not great and looked different from website had to upgrade to premier to get a nicer room and it wasnt as nice as hoped still ,0
 The room did not appear to share the classical feel of the hotel It felt far cheaper than the 235 I paid But the bathroom was excellent ,0
 Can t think of anything really ,0
 No issues,0
 The bathroom sink was very close to the toilet therefore lack of room to sit on the toilet properly would be a struggle for a larger person especially a male to sit on in comfort Also lack of mirrors light in the room a nice dressing table chair but no big mirror light to get ready in front of ,0
 Hotel is going through a major refund but is definately looking tired,0
 Would have been nice to have a view of Russel Square from the room but luck of the draw I guess ,0
 Having no lift Found the 3rd floor very hard to climb the stairs as I m restricted because of health problem Definitely would go back to this hotel Only on a ground floor ,0
 The breakfast was always the same the room and bathroom VERY SMALL the fruit juices were not fresh the staff that opened the doors was always grumpy,0
 The bed that was not so confortabl My room was looking in the inner part of the building and was really noisy outside ,0
 Not convinced that teaspoons were replaced each day as they had a feint residual smell No double glazing so room a bit cold and moisture inside window overnight Ridiculous price for breakfast originally 19 which I declined ,0
 Had room overlooking courtyard which had massive air conditioning units they were really noisy needed earplugs Tea and milk was not replenished,0
 This isn t a dislike but our bathroom was looking abit tired and needed a face lift But having so many rooms I am sure the upgrade will get there We were on tge 7th floor ,0
 We had more than a little trouble with a window right next to the bed that we couldn t get closed which caused a very uncomfortable draft in my small room The concierge tried helping and we put in a request for maintenance but it was two windows causing the issue They fixed one the second night but not the other ,0
 Had to change rooms twice once because the bath had a chip in it the mirror had a big crack across it and the alternative room given was tiny for the price paid I feel the up keep of some of the rooms is quite poor given the star rating of the hotel We also had to pay to upgrade to a better room which I don t think was fair given the rooms we were offered originally and the quality of them,0
 I have used this hotel a few times before and never been disappointed however our room this time 118 was quite shabby inside compared to previous visits There wasn t even any bottled water Also on trying to find the room at 11 30pm after a long day the signage was very misleading and led us to a door which was closed off and unavailable due to construction We then had to get a member of staff to show us the alternative route which we would never have found had we followed the brass signage ,0
 the shower in my room kept collapsing the wind howled through the window all night such that the air conditioning v noisy kept kicking in to keep the temperature up kept coming on i eventually had to turn it off We had a whisky nightcap in the bar which had bits floating in it The waitress explained it was from the ice We had specifically ordered without ice It took two of us complaining twice to get it changed V poor considering 12 50 per glass Breakfast v average more like a 3 star hotel ,0
 Cold room no fridge or mini bar TV was useless and would barely work room was a bit tired ,0
 sound insulation our room gave on the street and it was really noisy small bed a bit expensive,0
 I wanted to do a checkout the night before I left due to an early train and I was surprised it wasn t possible The next morning checkout took a little longer than planned and we missed a train to the airport getting us there later than planned But the great thing was Reception had kindly printed our boarding cards for us which made up the time ,0
 I have been staying at the Russell several times a year for twenty years though less frequently now I feel that breakfast arrangements are less customer friendly than they used to be paper napkins have replaced fabric there are no saucers for the coffee cups and I had to go hunting for a desert spoon and a teaspoon ,0
 My room on the 7th floor had been refurbished but some of the fittings were of poor quality and should have been rejected ,0
 Room small overlooking air con units and the windows were screwed shut Had to rely on air con not a comfortable night ,0
 Breakfast was tasty and good value at 12 but not if we had had to pay full price of 19 ,0
 its a very old hotel undergoing rehab which made for some noise and dust However the worse part of the hotel was the internet We needed to work and were unable to connect to anything workable Its a cool old hotel but if you re going on business and need internet bring your own ,0
 Reception were exceptionally slow at booking in checking out The rooms were very tatty paint flaikinh off the wall the sink was cracked etc Lack of vegetarian food available ,0
 Opaque window so had no view,0
 Long waiting time at check in which was not yet peak time Noisy difficult getting to sleep and woken up early for the same reason,0
 we had no cold running water with 2 days to go we were offered another room which was a bit of an inconvenience to move our things and room was much smaller we were offered breakfast on next 2 mornings as compensation as it wasn t included in our price so that did make things a lot more acceptable ,0
 The Windows in the bedroom had broken sashes and paint flacking off and odd bodged tiles around the toilet,0
 Windows are made with frosted glass so there is no way to see the view or even to open them No mini fridge in the room There is no information on how to call the reception from the room The sink in the bathroom was blocked and hook for the towels was just laying in the hole detached from the wall photos attached Moreover there was very strange sound coming from the street which was annoying and disturbed our sleep Water costs 5 ponds per bottle Do not feel like 4 stars at all ,0
 The confusion at check in as I d altered the booking from double and a single room refunderble to a twin and single none refunderble they said that I still had the refunderble booked and needed to pay as to late to cancel luckerly I had proof on my phone but they still insisted I contact booking com to check,0
 We had a broken cold tap in the bathroom which couldn t be repaired that day We booked an alarm call for 6 30am which came late There was no trouser press in the room We had paid extra for an upgrade WE,0
 Pillows were lumpy shower drained very slowly so you have to keep stopping it for it to drain breakfast way overpriced at 19 80 asked for a nice view but had a horrid one so kept curtains closed ,0
 WOULD APPRECIATE A 2 LEVEL CHARGE FOR BREAKFAST I ONLY EAT A BOWL A CEREAL MATRESS TOO SOFT ,0
 Small beds Premier Inn is ahead of most hotel chains on this front Also cost of a glass of wine at 10 for a relatively basic Malbec was a bit steep but they have to make their money back somewhere ,0
 The breakfast could have been cheaper ie included in the price We were with a party of 17 there wasn t any negotiation on the price ,0
 It was a bit noisy with busy road just outside,0
 The room was much smaller than the one we had last time ,0
 Despite it being Midwinter the temperature of the rooms was very high and the air conditioning made no difference Even the alternative room we were offered was just as hot ,0
 During my last 2 days the WiFi connection became very weak and spotty Staff said it was being worked on but I sensed that a fast resolution wasn t high enough priority ,0
 The windows in our room were unfortunately in need of repair with one rather loose glass pane rattling every so often from the traffic on the streets below Traffic is heavy from 6am so this meant no lie in for me Double glazing may help ,0
 the bathroom is very small so there wasnt enough room to put my toiletries ,0
 Light fittings and bathroom door were dirty cooked breakfast was very greasy and not enough electric sockets available ,0
 bathroom a bit old and it wasn t cleaned properly Room itself was excellent ,0
 Room was clean but in need of some repairs eg broken tiles on bathroom floor and bottom drawers badly worn ,0
 Despite being in the heart of London but the location is very noisy and inconvenient A lot of people move around super noisy and you would never feel piece of mind on top of that single rooms are very small like a grave I would never stay there again ,0
 Location was not very entertaining from tourist point of view I had a room with inside view so felt very suffocated ,0
 TV is at a height and an angle where you cant watch it when sitting in a chair You either have to sit far away or stand up not to get a distorted view Breakfast not being included in the room rate is a big minus for me ,0
 The mattress bed sheets comforter and pillow not comfy enough Aicon a bit noisy ,0
 the noise level in my room from the ventilation put it this way I woke up 3 times,0
 Not a dislike but some areas could do with a spring clean Its a busy hotel so difficult to close areas off to follow this through However this would not stop me from staying here again,0
 The noise It was extremely noisy in the morning from 5am with the sound of sirens going to the nearby hospitals Every 3 minutes in fact The standard twin was small and bathroom tiny ,0
 Ran out of hot food items eg bacon sausages left waiting for breakfast on both days windows don t open in the rooms for security reasons so no fresh air in the room Hotel bar prices are quite expensive ,0
 Air conditioning horrendously noisy cutting in with a loud bang every 20 mins throughout the night Very poor sleep as a result ,0
 The public areas were very grand but our room was a little worn the windows were filthy there were lights missing and the bathroom floor was not entirely clean ,0
 The window in room 524 was very old and was a draft coming in from the gaps ,0
 We were in a family room Frosted Windows looking at brick wall No natural light and room was very old and cold Not enough towels or toiletries for us all,0
 No bath in the room inside courtyard facing window horrible view Windows wouldn t stay open shower door wouldn t close Very small television and phone located in bathroom ,0
 Price ok for a business trip though slightly high considering breakfast wasn t included in room price Upgraded room could have been nicer ,0
 Some of the staff are not very helpful not professional The facilities are bad e g small left not suitable for people with wheelchair or having many large luggage My room was very small with tiny sink in which the water not moving easily rapidly get full The do not disturb sign was missing ,0
 the chaise lounge in the room needs some attention looks a bit shabby ,0
 we had 2 rooms booked and one wasnt ready at check in time we had to wait an hour for it the bathrrom in one of the rooms was tiny,0
 Lifts are little small so at busy times and with suitcases became a challenge More drawer space would ve been helpful and compliment refreshments tray would ve benefitted from bottled water Room overlooked all the boiler pipes etc which at times was very loud Nice breakfast but over priced for what it was,0
 We stayed last year and our room was nicer didn t like the view from 246 the machines heaters or what ever they were noisy However would still stay again ,0
 The room was drafty but it s an old building and the room was on the corner I expected it and it wasn t much of an issue ,0
 Rooms are too small there is no water or mini bar available at rooms Small water is offered within the price almost given every hotel including 3 stars rooms are too cold and the heating system of the room is not sufficient to heat the room ,0
 No notice given fire alarm tested no staff on floors to say there was not a fire Rooms not cleaned until very late in the day,0
 The bathroom is very small,0
 The frosted windows limited light to some extent but then again views in London can be rather poor ,0
 I was initially given a room which had no WiFi and without heating Room was freezing cold I was offered to t have a electric heater to warm up the room The room was changed but the one which was changed was much smaller and was noisy The wash basin had non functional tap Luckily I had one night stay booked only Won t like to stay in this hotel ever again Not recommended ,0
 Maid didn t make the room two days,0
 Very very poor sleep during stay ,0
 Odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms Don t people have the internet The dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down Staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being 3 people behind the bar chatting to each other All in all a great hotel but not well run ,0
 We felt that the bathroom was missing several items that you would expect to find in such a hotel I e Toilet brush shower cap cotton wool face cloths The room had a very narrow window looking out over a boiler or something similar This was supposed to be a superior room but that was hard to believe ,0
 Windows need cleaning Shower slow to drain and sink faucet leaks need fixing The only real complaint is that the doors of other rooms closing along with the fire doors at night are fairly noisy and could keep a light sleeper up ,0
 The air conditioning in are room didn t work so well so it got really warm didn t feel the need to complain as we loved staying a spa would of been nice in the hotel also,0
 The hotel ventilation units were just outside the window working 24 7 you can not imagine the noise check the photos No refrigerator Room was rather small,0
 This property is listed as accessible My daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods THIS FACILITY IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE IF THEY SET UP A MOTORIZED DEVICE much like a stairway system installed in one s home Can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went The embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated I ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the 5 6 steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing This facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times In fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair The staff requires education Later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system Please change your listing to not accessible The table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over The bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed ,0
 Lack of toilet facilities on the ground floor Opposite end of the hotel to the restaurant and bar which when you have mobility issues can be a long trek ,0
 The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas We were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room This turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows Noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small Was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room ,0
 I generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because Carluccio s is close at hand and I am more interested in Italian cuisine than a more conservative English hotel cuisine I hesitate to say that I am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects Nevertheless these might be the only parts of the Russell that would benefit from change That being said however few hotels manage change successfully and I would hate to see the Russell lose its undoubted charm ,0
 The bed was itself very uncomfortable and very noisy which really spoil tour trip The pillows were well used and lumpy The breakfast was not the best coffee and tea were not great tasting some breakfast items were Luke warm and queuing up to make toast ,0
 Found the room far to hot comparable to when I slept in Egypt but that s probably personal to me Would of liked a room with a view but what do you expect when paying less than normal price and you are only sleeping ,0
 Bedroom was small but to be expected staying in a double room in London if you wanted something spacious maybe upgrade to a delux we didn t and regretted it But overall enjoyable hotel would defiantly return,0
 The room we had was v small for the amount we paid 135 for one night You could only just walk around the bed and there was hardly any space to store clothes,0
 no mini bar in the room and the temperature controls didn t function properly Small tv screen ,0
 Our room was very substandard for a deluxe double with cracks on the bathroom floor a leaking sing no mirror with the vanity table the bed was not completed with cushions and throws and the overall ambiance of the room was awful ,0
 Staff not as professional as I remember Layout of the reception Entrance Hall does not reflect the grandeur of the hotel ,0
 I had to wait over 45 minutes for a bar meal ,0
 No double glazing on our windows so traffic noise awful from 5am No conditioner in the bathroom no shower caps breakfast food was pretty ordinary Seems like it s now aiming at the Imperial hotels market which is frankly down market Used to do better ,0
 Room was tired looking very small and Windows had so much condensation damp I had to use a towel to dry it off Not good for my asthma,0
 I didn t like the breakfast for the price it cost I ve stayed at other 4 Star hotels with much more variety The bed creaked and in order to open the door with the card I had to make several attempts ,0
 We have stayed here many times and will again but we were this time under a very creaky floor room 625 so were disturbed by noise several times which has never happened before Will maybe avoid this room next time ,0
 The lifts are very small Breakfast has no fresh salad such as sliced tomatoes cucumbers I would also add some more selection of cheese and sausages,0
 The first room they gave us smelt of cigarettes Then we were put in a tiny room sink was blocked shower didn t work properly also the television didn t work very well ,0
 Would have expected a touch more luxury in the rooms for the price Shower hard to control and poor flow mouldy silicone sealant cracked tiles Not really worth the extra money back to premier inn in future ,0
 Breakfast was too expensive so went elsewhere could hear a low generator humming throughout the night,0
 Bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable Room a little dated and check in was slow Due to roads being closed around Bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to 45 mins later we found it Was only a short walk so could be better on other days ,0
 The bathroom was that small you couldn t reach the sink unless you were stood sideways If the radiator had been on it would have been very uncomfortable,0
 I have never seen a worse bed in any hotel I ve stayed in anywhere in the world Was well past its best and staff knew it as they instantly refunded my payment ,0
 tray of used crockery etc outside my door when checking in to my room Still there several hours later thermostat limited on very cold night Not warm enough ,0
 however the rooms were not maintaned so well as the common parts of the hotel TV handler did not work wifi did not work phone in the room did not work Concierge was nice and came into my room to repair but definetly rooms are overpriced they are old and need a strong refurbishment ,0
 The buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet I ve ever had Plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology Sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease Such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel ,0
 Decor is extremely tired and dated Wallpaper peeling off walls windows did not open mould around window edges and in shower grouting antiquated bathroom and a standalone heater in the bedroom Dust around edges of carpet I m not sure how this is acceptable in a central London hotel which costs upwards of 110 per night Definitely will not be recommending this hotel to friends or re visiting myself although I can t praise the staff enough ,0
 Had a bad experience with room service 45 minutes we waited until we called to chase up then we were told it would be another 15 minutes Clearly they didn t make note of our order from our first call We also paid for late check out until 2pm but were disturbed 3 times by housekeeping obvious lack of communication ,0
 Bathroom could be more taken care of windows were old and a little worn off There could be possibility to go to the balcony,0
 Personal not amiable The room did not match the pictures on the website The AC in my room was really noisy and it took me 4 visits to the reception for them to change my room ,0
 Bring earplugs Lots of traffic noise but no problem with earplugs in ,0
 Bar and lounge area were very dark so made it difficult to read books or magazines or any literature that we wanted to review for a next days adventures,0
 The breakfast experience is like something out of BHS They need to make it a little more like an quality hotel experience Also the bar is a disaster they don t know whether they are running a pub type facility ie bar service or a lounge facility ie waiter service I won t go in again ,0
 My room wasn t very clean Dirt chunks coming out of heater onto desk When I mentioned that at front desk they just smiled at me White spots on extra blanket So I didn t want to use it Although I love the location and this is my 2nd stay it will probably be my last ,0
 There was a large cobweb in the corner above the TV room 225 The bar area was difficult to find a seat so I had to resort to staying in my room when I just needed to sit down rest and have a well deserved beer ,0
 Had to wait for a second room as first one did not offer a bath as requested Freezing room until radiators kicked in Tired carpet Poor insulated windows,0
 Auto service charge Paying extra for breakfast Good food but no better than other UK 3 4 star I ve stayed in No soundproofing ,0
 The bar prices are astronomically high so we left the hotel and spent the evenings elsewhere ,0
 We booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly They moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was 2 single beds pushed together They gave us the 60 it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there They then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine For the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again ,0
 My room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience ,0
 Not very clean and rooms not really looked after lots of little things were very worn dirty or broken in the bathroom and room ,0
 Breakfast pricing of 19 for 2 ppl was not included in our stay deal Seemed a tad disproportionate and unfair but perhaps London thinks it can justify that price for egg bacon a sausage toast and tea we had breakfast at Giraffe Cafe 2 minutes away very nice ,0
 We got a room that was very small and not very fresh The pictures on the hotels website for std dbl room was not what we got We could change room though ,0
 We had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast Our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight I was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users I also found I kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests The shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height I required and needed constant raising We went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two So why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier ,0
 Staff at the reception didn t give us 2 sets of cards The lights went in one of the rooms and no one told me that my son was moved to another room ,0
 No leisure gym facilities ,0
 The decor while nice is a little tired e g fabric on chair is torn woodwork chipped This was only a small point but is a bit out of step with the grand exterior and reception area of the hotel ,0
 Some noise at times if staying on the front of the Hotel from road noise But the windows and curtains muffle that overnight ,0
 Only a few things the blind in the bathroom covered with dirty fingerprints and the one in the bedroom coming away from windowframe Also couldn t get the shower to work but that may just have been me ,0
 Bar staff did not know that a egg benedict had bacon in it No wake up alarm despite the fact that they asked if i wanted it ,0
 Unwanted alarm call at 7 am rather spoiled my day But got our breakfasts free to compensate so pleased with that Breakfast room needs refurbishment to make more of the Titanic connection ,0
 Pillows hard Shower tray didnt drain had to time shower Outside patio door didnt fit draughts to room,0
 The room which we were in was a standard one needs a revamp There was black mild on bathroom tiles if any older persons were stopping in that room it s very difficult to get into the bath ,0
 the food choice in the restaurant is not very pronounced and exciting more fresh fruit at breakfast,0
 During our stay there was a problem with the toilet not clearing however this was fixed fairly quickly and another room given to use that toilet whilst we were inconvenienced So a minus and a plus here We had a meal arranged for Christmas lunch and my wife who is partially disabled had to flag down a taxi for herself directly outside the hotel even though there was concierge staff on duty nearby I was angry at the lack of helpfulness ,0
 Room was small and very basic for price but bed very comfortable View was onto a wall Would be nice to have a mini bar fridge and water plus additional wall sockets We had to unplug TV to charge phone I pad,0
 The beds vere hard and unplesant The rooms old and need a renovation The staff in the bar did not know what a frozen cosmopolitan was And they did not give u time to look at the bar meny They wanted to take ur order the minutt you sat foot in the bar Not good at all The hotel was to expensive all in all ,0
 That s the beds were not secured and if you sat up in bed to watch TV or read the bed moved forward away from wall The bathroom was a bit cramped around the toilet due to the large sink There was a smell coming from the sink when you used it I think its needs some bleach We did not eat breakfast at the hotel due to the price of 19 50 each for 2 nights would be nearly 80 00 We ate out instead ,0
 expensive breakfast went to pret some fittings not right bathroom door did not shut plug in sink didn t Forgivable because its such an iconic building but certainly not competition to the best in the west end ,0
 The bar was closed when we returned at 1 o clock on new years eve They wouldnt even bring us a drink to the room ,0
 Old hotel with small rooms for 4 stars Construction work right outside my window Could not sleep Did not effect price Rather stay in a modern hotel with upgraded facilities ,0
 Room was smaller than cheaper hotel next door Less facilities I e tea coffee selection Music from wedding booming until 12 30 pm Though they did pay for two breakfasts to compensate ,0
 The TV didn t work in the standard rooms it s very dated very basic and not what I d expect from a 4star hotel premier inn would have been better shower had mould sort of inside the sealant really noisey this place needs the double glazing looking at,0
 The quality of the mattress of the bed was really bad For the money I paid I expected at least a decent mattress ,0
 Far from the attractions and Russell Square tube is pointless,0
 The hair dryer was attached to a unit that was positioned approximately 8 feet away from the dressing table This is too far away when trying to style your hair Fortunately I had taken my own hair dryer The lighting in the room was too low It would have been helpful to have had a bright light positioned by the dressing table to make drying of hair and putting on of make up that much easier ,0
 missed breakfast one day as insufficient capacity in the restaurant and the wait would have been too long as I had to go to a meeting,0
 Wifi didnt work in the room Staff weren t as polite as you would expect for the price Despite changing the key numerous times none of them worked well for the door Cant control water temperature No free water daily Restaurant food disappointing All in all we cant recommend this hotel ,0
 Trainee receptionist at front desk was rude and abrupt Very poor and mean selection of tea coffee etc in hotel room and the same for shampoo moisturising etc samples in bathroom ,0
 I ordered a sandwich from the limited room service available after 10pm but was very disappointed that the beef slices had an inch of thick fat on each This was extremely poor quality ,0
 The dining room was too full and very noisy We did not like having to queue for a table The tap in the bathroom leaked ,0
 I feel that the bathroom showers baths could be improved and made more user friendly Having to clamber into the bath to have your shower should be a thing of the past,0
 The staff could have been a little more helpful with our luggage They didn t seem to realise that helping us from the door to the lifts would have been a huge help However the staff were very friendly which made up for that ,0
 Although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice Our room was really nice the first night large room with a window We decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room Very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool There was a bank of about 50 air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy The bathroom stunk of mold and Lynx deodorant The drains were blocked and the bed was terrible It was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night Between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all I think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing An upgrade was offered to us the second night for 20 pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night But we definitely didnt On a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible Super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex Not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place ,0
 The main light in the bedroom didn t work and although maintenance came quickly it was never replaced meaning the room was quite dark We also thought we would have a safety deposit box in our room which turned out not to be there ,0
 The exterior of the building is magnificent but the interior has seen better days and in need of a refurb At the end of the day the rooms are compact clean and comfortable just don t plan on spending too much time in them which you shouldn t be get outside and see some stuff or go hang in a pub ,0
 Shower ,0
 Breakfast on Sunday morning was a disaster Arriving half an hour before service was due to close we found a queue to get a table with many many tables waiting to be cleared there was no hot food left and a real shortage of staff Hot food did not finally all come through until an hour after we arrived at the restaurant Staff were great throughout ,0
 Some staff not helpful few problems with the room Leaky shower door bed on castors with brakes that didn t work a rattling window and a loose connection on tv,0
 The positives seem to end with the building The staff were pretty rude and dismissive particularly in the bar where it seemed like it was all too much effort to bring the food or take a drinks order The room was freezing and the hot water broke for a period of time The breakfast was in a nice room but again it was freezing and most people seemed to have their coats on ,0
 disappointed that our upgrade did not live up to expectations of pictures on the invitation email which I suspect were from a different hotel altogether This was misleading The suite was very noisy with traffic on the road outside and noise from the stair well just outside the door I felt this was poor value for the additional money spent ,0
 room key was older strip type which failed to work even the replacement was temperamental which was a bit of an inconvenience with me being located on the 8th floor ,0
 Very poor Water pressure in sink and had to run tap for several minutes before vaguely warm Toulet did not flush properly Very difficult to climb into bath and shower was one of those you Have to stand in the water flow to adjust Risking scalding or freezing Shower was freezing in morning with no hot water for 5 mins Had to give up Furnishings a little tired ,0
 One staff member on check in was obviously having a bad day The other staff however were very helpful ,0
 Room was very warm ,0
 STAFF UNPLEASANT WALKING PAST LOTS OF SMOKERS EVERY TIME YOU RETURNED TO THE HOTEL VIEW OF SKY DISHES TOILETRIES WATER ETC NOT REPLENISHED FURNITURE IN ROOM MARKED DIRTY ,0
 The heating in the restaurant was not working with the air conditioning locked in the on position Not possible to enjoy eating there in the evening Original room allocated was not as requested small and with one small double bed Not able to move room until the next day and then only at an additional charge Very small bar area with nowhere else to sit with friends ,0
 Upgrade at 40 per night which had been previously at 31 online View across park from 638 obscured by grime on external window but not a big issue though was area son for taking upgrade,0
 No adverse experiences whatsoever ,0
 Booked and paid for this booking for a colleague she doubled checked all was paid on check in was told all okay Then was made to pay a supplement on checkout Have since emailed looking for the GMs name so I could get their feedback on my colleagues experience to date haven t heard back from them As a company we will not use hotel again ,0
 The two night stay was a little pricey for a relatively small room and with no breakfast included although the room was clean quiet and comfortable ,0
 There was a wedding on which made it a little noisy when sleeping despite asking for a room at the back so it was quiet ,0
 Room 203 dirty filthy windows with some double glazed panels missing from the frames cracked floor tiles in bathroom dirty basin old creased badly fitted carpet And dirty greasy finger marks above the bed Bulbs out Tv not working Not what I would expect for 4 star,0
 Single room was rather noisy due to hvac system duct outside and poor quality single pane windows offering little insulation Non smoking room requested but hall had a hint of tobacco ,0
 The continual noise from the air conditioning heating fans outside and the loud beats of music from a party evening both making it difficult to get to sleep ,0
 Pillows were too soft without an option in the room Lifts were a bit of a problem on our final day,0
 Could not find our booking on arrival eventually found not listed under my surname Chaos leaving luggage as early check in was not actioned Lots of fire doors to get through with luggage to room Key card to door faulty and had to be reprogrammed ,0
 Non working central heating Draught noise of traffic coming in from the Windows Considering we paid for an upgrade some aspects were very ordinary i e only 1 Earl grey tea bag Decoration of room very dated ,0
 Claustrofobic size of a room The fact that every time I wanted to use wi fi I needed to logg in extremely annoying The very thin duvet and lack of a spare blanket No signal on TV,0
 As lead organiser of our group I was rather dissapointed when being given a small room at the back of the Hotel on the 5th floor ,0
 Shabby room,0
 Junior Suite Cold and uncomfortable room no bath and the shower screen was cracked and a possible health hazard Could not keep the room warm A very second rate experience The management paid for our replacement room in the Holiday Inn,0
 The noise An event was in in the hotel and the music was loud Not what I would expect for such a hotel The manager on duty that night was rude and un helpful The bed was uncomfortable and broken The hotel itself is beautiful such a shame the night for us was ruined by loud music and an unhelpful night manager We received a full refund for out night stay ,0
 We had one incidence of noise from fellow residents but phoned reception and they sorted it out very quickly,0
 Paid to upgrade to a suite had to ask for a dressing gown Room very shabby No sleep because of traffic noise throughout the night told Reception on check out no discount offered ,0
 The steps at the front entrance made it difficult for my girlfriend who uses a wheelchair however the door staff were 100 wonderful and made it as easy as possible I understand that it s a listed building and not something that can be changed ,0
 Dirty bathroom door torn carpet wardrobe door did not close Missing reading light at bed leaving a hole Dirty bathroom blind Left letter of complaint have not had a response 48 hours later,0
 House keeping came knocking on our bedroom door at 9am Sunday morning Before I woke up realised what was happening she was letting herself into the room I did get an apology from reception staff It wouldn t put me off staying there though ,0
 The hotel rooms and corridors are very run down in desperate need of renovation The bed was pushed into the corner meaning one person had to climb over the bed The furniture was damaged and the blind was hanging off of the window Not what i expect from a 4 star hotel Was very disappointed ,0
 The windows of the room we stayed in were badly insulated there was a draft but as we didn t stay in the room much during daytime it was ok ,0
 Unacceptable level of customer service Once we arrived we paid for an upgrade for a more spacious room with a view The room was indeed lovely yet the temperature in the room was extremely low it was FREEZING COLD They send us an engineer to fix the air conditioning system We spent approximately 2 hours calling at the reception and waiting for the engineer to finish his work waiting for the air conditioning system to be fixed At some point we had to leave the room because we had scheduled business appointments The hotel personnel reassured us that by the time we would be back everything would be fine At 11 30pm when we returned to the room we faced the same condition a freezing cold room We spent one hour fighting with the duty manager and the hotel personel till they brought us 2 portable heaters in the room and we eventually managed to heat the room with those heaters The air conditioning system never worked as the hotel personnel kept insisting ,0
 The side facing the road is a bit noisy The position of the TV in my room is a bit odd the angle is wrong for sitting down ,0
 I booked one double room for myself and my husband and a twin room for my daughters The girls room was lovely and spacious giving them great comfort whereas ours was rather cramped with a small bathroom and not much space to get in and out of the door once our suitcase was on the case stand I also felt the wardrobes were not deep enough to fit suites in without the doors staying open This was even more restricted by the ironing board being located in the wardrobe too ,0
 Double room size is not as the pictures lighting in the room is noisy no fridge water in bathroom switches hot to cold suddenly room is cold so I had to open air conditioning to heat,0
 The room was very cramped hot very noisy the en suite was tiny and had a cracked basin dripping shower We pointed this out to staff but didn t appear interested Breakfast was very basic I spend a lot of time in hotels feel this was not even a budget hotel standard ,0
 It will be nice when the furniture up grades are completed,0
 boiler broke so no hot water the shower temperature control the heating and the towel rail didn t work the bathroom was tiny ,0
 shower very poor water pressure low water temp control non existent,0
 Very noisy motors all night presumably from air condition outlets Shower difficult to control as hot tap was broken but not discovered until the morning when needing to get out for a meeting so no time to ask for it to be fixed Bar area insufficient for the size of hotel Had hoped for a quiet drink before departure but bar overflowing with guests about to attend a function ,0
 Room was very small for cost and view from window was shocking a brick wall as a result the room was very dark Not enough tea coffee and sugar for cost of room ,0
 room was shabby broken shower parts TV small and grainy and limited options,0
 Thought the room was compact and bijou Bathroom was situated right next to one of the beds fell out of bed into the bathroom Lovely view of a brick wall and generators For the room and view thought it was overpriced ,0
 Heating wasn t working which took two visits from the technicians to sort out in the space of four and a half hours ,0
 Cold dining room at breakfast croissants etc should have been warm ,0
 Booked a superior room for two and had the confirmation for that At arrival they told us the room was not available and offered two single rooms instead We declined so we got what they call standard double The room was minuscule had no heating at all the window that went on an inner courtyard was completely condensed after half an hour we tried to warm up the room with the hairdryer In addition to that the curtain didn t go up at all The overall experience was absolute sub standard in compensation they offered after some discussion a complementary breakfast and a 20 discount I wouldn t come back here anyway and I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody From the outside it s really beautiful Once passed the doors it s another story ,0
 1 As usually most of hotels in EUR have small rooms 2 they didn t have fridge 3 a little be it expensive,0
 Our junior suite was exceptionally tired A challenging room very noisy and cold not at all restful in any way Wires hanging under the tv poor standard of decoration especially in the bathroom Taps in bath overbath shower very stiff and difficult to regulate No water or hot water on the final day Dirty walls in bathroom Poor recognition of problems by staff zero response Mouldy bread in toast bin at breakfast ,0
 No hot water in the morning as the boilers broke which meant we couldn t get a shower bath before leaving The kettle leaked from the glass indicator so we was unable to use that too For 200 I expected a lot more ,0
 The facilities were quite basic so I felt it was quite expensive for what it was The view from our room was very disappointing and it took a long time to speak to anybody in reception ,0
 No bad experience the Tempus bar needs some refurbishment especially the carpet and the fire place needs to be cheerier especially near Xmas Its a bit dull and dismal overall Ulster carpets recently refurbished the Castletroy Park Hotel in Limerick Ireland they supplied the first carpets which lasted 25 years and the new carpets which transformed the hotel Ditch that dirty burgundy carpet asap ,0
 No Hot water for a few hours on a Sunday at 9am not exactly what you want when wanting a shower No alternative facilities offered Bar closed at 1am,0
 The breakfast was a bit pricy compared to quality The rooms bathroom was cold And the hotel resturant was not good compared to the quality of the rest of hotel ,0
 The rooms are variable in size and ours was a little small but very comfortable and clean Others in our party had bigger rooms ,0
 Need to pay 10 Pound for 1 hour late check out even though having notified hotel in advance Other hotels we stayed DO NOT need to pay 10 pound for 1 hour late check out They are free for 1 hour late check out ,0
 I booked the Champagne Shopping package I expected Champagne not just a sparkling wine This was my only disappointment ,0
 Our double room was dated only view was of a collection of air con units the tiniest bathroom ever to run a bath one had to get in to do so poor shower once you could get it going basin area so small was difficult to wash face and teeth Disgusting dirty grouting between basin and shower screen Breakfast area congested and two mornings in a row had to ask for bread Totally underwhelmed by this place ,0
 I couldn t connect wifi using room number and my registered email i called reception but didn t help Finally I was provided an access code at the front desk Better to simplfy the wifi access ,0
 Took up an offer to upgrade to a deluxe suite which was very poor,0
 I booked a room for myself and 2 sisters It was a superior room with 2 double beds but it was only set up for 2 people so we had to ask for everything extra I e towels tea and coffee toiletries which was a bit annoying We booked well in advance so it wasn t like they didn t know we were arriving That was the only downside of our stay as the hotel is lovely and it wouldn t put us of staying again,0
 VERY over priced Stated as a four star and in my opinion not even close Room floor squeaked every where was annoying unless you made it a game to try and walk from bed to bath without squeaking not possible Room given was NOT the room pictured in the ad when I reserved as junior suite not even close although I was told on site it was one of the best buyer beware Shower bath access was difficult and I am very agile The tub rim to step over was to my knee caps and I am 6 3 so if you are short good luck ,0
 The single room is small but I was more bothered by the noise from the hallway The walls are very thin Also there was a little mold on the shower wall on my first night It was removed after I called the front desk about it the next morning Otherwise the bathroom was nice ,0
 Wish I had been given the potted history booklet on registration as I would have had more of an explore ,0
 Our room was one of the top twin room paid 320 a night but no slippers no bath gowns no face cloth Very poor toiletries Bath tub handle was not clean and rusty water has been dripping And bath room was very cold Room has a one very cheap small table which wobble so badly with two armchairs Not impressed at all ,0
 First had a room in the loft which was extrememly warm and some kind of machine noise outside if we opened the window Not a good night s sleep Very expensive breakfast,0
 The location and rooms were lovely therefore it was a shame to be disappointed with the check in process taking at least an hour and with a long queue forming behind On check out the long process was repeated along with forgetting to remove an amount from our credit card for sundries although saying they would do so,0
 The Receptionist advised us that our room had a nice view of the park however on getting to our room you had to stand on the bed look out of the very small window to see the park ,0
 only comment was there was no milk provided on our third day in our room ,0
 Returned 1530 to get ready for an early evening concert to find room not cleaned etc No real apology from desk staff not told what was happening no complaint form available when requested A cup of tea while we waited would have been a nice gesture During our wait heard other guests complaining about the same situation and they were in a suite Not a four star experience Whilst the room was spacious the bathroom left a lot to be desired Access to a small sink was in a gap about 18 inches wide down the side of the bath with a shower screen further reduced by a heated towel rail that projected approx 5 6 inches on the wall side The choice was between bump or burn ,0
 I was disappointed with both of the rooms I booked and not sure if I would book again because of this They looked very tiered and in desperate need of a revamp The photos online are misleading of the bedroom and the bathroom was also poor also there was a leak on the stares and had buckets out catching water ,0
 The breakfast was ok but I would except much more from 4 stars hotel The business point needs update The printer wasn t working the chairs were so bed I was worried I will fall down Only Irish newspaper ,0
 Twin room Bathroom was ridiculously tiny a real squeeze to get to the tiny basin good job the heated towel rail wasn t on ,0
 The air conditioning was difficult to control but this may have been down to the unusually mild weekend we enjoyed,0
 Rooms could do with a bit updating but that is my personnel opinion ,0
 The supposedly double bed room was too narrow and the room was closer to a single than to a double bed room The tv too small No mini bar Even the towels were for one person Plus the inside view was awful and there was a continuous noise from the power installations But after my complaints they transferred me to one much better ,0
 Our room was very hot couldn t keep the window open because of the noise the room backed on to the courtyard with all the generators hammering away The air con unit didn t do much Continental breakfast was average ,0
 Staff in the morning on arrival friendly and helpful staff at night appeared to be unhappy in their job and with each other ,0
 Bar area small for a big hotel we wanted to take a coffee in there one afternoon but all the seats where taken but only around 15 people in there,0
 I was in one of the inner rooms and experienced one of the worst nights sleep I have ever had at a hotel due to the noise of the generators all night ,0
 Beds very uncomfortable Room very hot we did not have a Window that you could see through,0
 The breakfast was adequate but not fantastic it s probably a good idea to get down early for the breakfast ,0
 Breakfast was almost 20 extra per person so we didn t have breakfast ,0
 IF I had to complain Id say that a bit of noise comes off the corridor I m not sure if it s the thickness of the walls or the acoustical rating on the door ,0
 Lack of double glazing meant it was a bit noisy but it is London ,0
 The rooms could do with a bit of refurbishment but that s being quite picky ,0
 the hotel room was filthy and infested with bugs Had to be moved into another room which wasn t very nice either ,0
 Looked like a room from the 1970s Dim and dismal decor old utility furniture Filthy windows Looked out onto a service shaft Extremely poor value for mopney I stay every few weeks in London usually closer to West End either Charing Cross or HorseGuards all are about the same price and infinitely nicer places to stay TV was tiny and no remote housekeeping brought us a spare ,0
 Tv was a little hard to understand but that s being picky,0
 Some small details disturbing the last day the room was not completely clean the small cookie MIETE on the nightstand ,0
 The bedding and bathroom were immaculate however The wooden sash windows were loose fitting and rattled so we wedged with tissues They were also really filthy on the outside masking the magnificent London skyline view from the sixth floor The kettle also had a significant leak when filled for 2 cups ,0
 Tired d cor loud air conditioning unit outside room Whitewashed windows so we could not see outside This was a bit oppressive ,0
 Rather expensive with small room and no breakfast included We have stayed nearby in similar rated hotels with better facilities and with breakfast included ,0
 The curtains didn t quite cover the window so despite the blackout blind I was awake as soon as it got light,0
 Breakfast did not meet the price Little variaty in food Room windows were out towards a shaft were the ventilation was very noisy all night Saturday night we had the pleasure of listening to the loud music from a nearby or in the house disco ,0
 Tried to contact room service but the phone rang for 10 minutes as the reception was busy ALL the numbers go through 0 including emergency and first aid requests There should be separate numbers for differing functions or more staff answering the phone ,0
 paint is pilling in our room ceiling constant noise of slamming doors due to the aggressive automatic door closer ,0
 Was shown a very small room when I arrived I felt it was too claustrophobic so I upgraded but for the price I paid it wasn t good plus I had to pay extra for breakfast ,0
 Overpriced bad nights sleep due to noise from the street and a strange squeaking noise which carried on day and night ,0
 We had a tiny room not comfortable at all The room would perhaps suit a single but not a double occupancy and should not be sold as such ,0
 could not get BB1 BB2 and ITV on television in room had to go to reception 3 times before it was sorted ,0
 Our children 17 and 14 shared a twin room on the same floor but their tea and coffee supply was not replenished ,0
 I stayed there 4 nights and these guys charged me 1500 punds on my credit card as security deposit during the check in Plus it has been 2 days after check out but 1500 pouns has not been put back How great to know i almost have no limit on my credit card,0
 The room was extremely small and as were staying for 4 nights was extremely cramped I had requested an upper floor room but was given a room on the first floor which I do nor class as an upper floor Our room was at the back of the hotel directly opposite a pub It was extremely noisy until the early hours and then the noise began again prior to 7am when they were obviously taking the empty bottle out ,0
 The room was quite dark and had too few electrical outlets If I needed to plug in my laptop I had to unplug the lamp as there was only one outlet near the desk That made the room even darker In 2015 a guest expects better Also your website says that the checkout time is 11 00 whereas according to the guest directory in the room it s 12 00 This inconsistency should be corrected ,0
 There s a lot more that could be done Unemptied bins ashtrays Basic amenities Single bedrooms are very small I was expecting small but still surprised ,0
 My error in believing my reservation included one more night but the HR handled this with grace despite my embarrassment ,0
 I had to print important information and was told the there were internet printing facilities yet the printer continued to give me an error message and I was unsuccessful in printing the documents I also didn t like that i was unable to go out on the balcony ,0
 Traffic noise as windows not double glazed some stains on upholstery windows in junior suite were dirty junior suite was a bit shabby drinks were expensive,0
 7th floor bedrooms,0
 the air conditioning in the room was broken the room was very warm during the night and we were unable to put the system on is it was making a banging noise ,0
 First room had an awful bathroom with tired and shabby decor including peeling paint on walls Bedroom was cold and basic On request was moved to much better room with great bathroom and a slightly better bedroom Not sure how there can be such a jump in standard for the same price ,0
 there was no halaal breakfast all meat was pork poor show this needs to be looked Beef lamb or chicken should be availible in a major city like London,0
 Tiny room uncomfortable bedding Pillows could have done with being replaced You could hear everything from the corridor and people stumbling into the adjoining rooms ,0
 Room was clean but the pillows and quilt were very old and need replacing The heater didnt work nor did the television The towel rail was cold and no way to turn it on ,0
 The room was freezing on arrival Touch ages to work the system out and at least an hour to warm up the room The shower was cranky and quite old Took forever to wash my hair Overall decent hotel but the price reflects the location not the hotel I wouldn t pay that amount anywhere else for the type of hotel but it is expected I suppose in central London ,0
 The room was spacious but chilly and the traffic noise from outside prevented us from having a good nights sleep There were two very large windows in the room both single glazed so outside noise was easily heard in the room ,0
 There wasn t anything we didn t like and would stay at the Hotel Russell again ,0
 Not exactly a bad experience but I was disappointed with the quality of facial and toilet tissues provided really cheap and nasty I expect more from a hotel of this rating ,0
 Not having a bath suite ,0
 The air con was rather noisy so we couldn t really use it even though the room was rather warm ,0
 The single room was very small and completely misrepresented in booking com It was really claustrophobic and tiny I could not upgrade and there was no fridge The worse that happened to me was when had to stay another night and checked online that they had available room and when I went to the front office to ask if I should book online or direct he informed me that the hotel was fully booked and if I booked online he would honour it but he would Rush before me to close the bookings Worse hotel experience ever,0
 Let down by lack of attention to detail Bedroom was cramped and lacked sufficient storage space if we had been staying more than one night we would not have had enough room to hang store clothes Bathroom had no soap holder so soap was left in a puddle on sink no additional bar of soap for shower,0
 Dinner which I told the head of Drinks and Catering was an absolute disgrace We didn t eat there again ,0
 The standard room was very small so upgraded which cost another 40 pound even though I d received an email saying it would visit 16 pound The stay turned out to be very expensive I ve paid at 50 less to stay in a better hotel,0
 Couldn t open any windows They were screwed shut Couldn t see out of any windows as a film had been put over them Not happy about this at all Felt shut off from the world and had to go downstairs to the main door to see what the weather was like It was also stifling hot in the morning because of this Walls seemed very thin and could hear every little noise in the corridors when trying to sleep ,0
 Bed was very small uncomfortable and noisy quite important when you re paying to sleep Room was small and loud due to the generators outside the window it was hot but you couldn t have the window open due to the noise air con sounded like an aeroplane was landing so couldn t have that on either ,0
 We were originally allocated a double room on the fifth floor which certainly left a lot to be desired The window was filthy and all the knobs on the furniture were either broken or loose Not worth 488 00 We were moved to the first floor purely because we requested a safety deposit box ,0
 Some signs of Wear and tear Cleanliness could be a bit better ,0
 The price did not include breakfast it was not expensive and we paid extra for it but it would have been far better if it had been included ,0
 The bed of the single room is so short that I would not fit in it and I am 190cm not exceptionally tall It should be clearly written about the small bed ,0
 Hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of English The receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at Hotel Russell just a week prior when we first arrived in London for the first half of our stay Had to request management to sort this out Her attitude was non too friendly during this experience As mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well The movie which cost a staggering 8 could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect Room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered When I called to check on the reason I was told that it was after 10 00pm and therefore it could not be delivered The original order had been called in before 9 00pm As if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which I had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on Friday we were told the reservations were for Saturday though I had an email confirmation of that Friday being our arrival date We were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved The location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at Hotel Russell ,0
 Cramped small bed Bar understaffed and waiter overwhelmed forgot one drink from order and it too 3 requests 45 minutes and Asking the mixologist directly the get the drink,0
 They offered us an upgrade which I paid for as it was my 65th birthday and I thought my wife would like it there but rather than an improvement the the room was the worst Ive had there and I have stayed a good number of times The Bathroom was in a shocking state The main air conditioning unit was right out side the window so we couldn t have the window open All in all as great disappointment ,0
 The blinds in the bathroom needed replacing as they were very frayed Also the ceiling needed repainting as there had obviously been a leak from the bathroom above ,0
 Only thing was Windows in bathroom need cleaned a lot of black mould on inside of them,0
 Internal rooms had noisy central air conditioning units outside window,0
 We lived on the 5th floor and windows were blocked Moreover when you turn on conditioner if smells dump So the room stayed humid all the time ,0
 The hot water was only warm in the shower bath was very hot by contrast and it didn t drain well,0
 I booked the junior suite on a last minute offer and got it for a good price however I would not have paid the full price Okay you are in central London but the bathroom could have a better finish And the tv didn t have a great reception ,0
 Room was very small but adequate for a one night stay Breakfast was not included in the price but was available at extra cost ,0
 We were given what I would describe as someone s flat that they let us have for the weekend It had two separate bathrooms one with a shower the other with a bath The sink in the bath bathroom did not work The staff basically said oh well The room had scuffs on the walls the carpet needed replacing and the bathrooms were obviously in disrepair The room was supposed to be of modern design but fell flat They should embrace the history of the hotel and reflect that in their rooms and service ,0
 Had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit At 340 for our 2 night stay I didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room I have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had There was a bath too I am only 5 feet tall and I couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense The bed was comfortable Everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall Will not return here ,0
 It needs a little revamping and we were told a big renovation plan was soon on the way,0
 Room was average for a 4 star hotel 150 was blocked against my credit card on arrival I paid the actual 1 night cost of 99 the next morning with a debit card but was told it would take up to 1 week for the 150 to be released from my credit card ,0
 small room dated dark decor very much a quick business stay or ideal fro travellers i prefer crown plaza level of comfort ,0
 Room small disappointing with the double bed pressed to one wall water serving bath and shower sink was luke warm not hot Whilst compared to other clients 175 for our small room with no breakfast was clearly a cheap offering by comparison to others available the 4 stars should relate to all rooms not just how impressive the lobby staircase are ,0
 Room was small with no view It was decorated cheaply very out of date and tired No mirror to get ready in ,0
 The design of the bathroom is appaling room 654 We could not wash our hands Although some of them are smiley the front desk reception could have been more helpful ,0
 The showers didn t get very hot,0
 The staff were very unfriendly in both the reception area and the restaurant we booked a twin room for our 3 night stay and when we checked in there was no twin room available and we had to take 2 small single rooms No apology I emailed 4 times about my booking no response I rang the hotel 3 times as my flight was delayed no answer We paid for the room on check in and when we went to check out they insisted that we didn t pay and had to find the card receipt to prove we had paid when we gave it to the receptionist we got no apology again and were not asked if we enjoyed our stay I would not stay at this hotel again ,0
 They did not book correct and desired room and expected us to pay for it anyways We were promised the room we intended the following day but that was a false promise ,0
 Room was so noisy The constant road noise is terrible No sleep No double glazing just old sash windows ,0
 Room they gave me was quite small and a little out dated Needs a spruce up ,0
 not easy to get the wifi to work on my iphone poorly stocked in room tea coffee supply,0
 Considering the price of the room the facilities are very basic Only enough tea and coffee for two drinks in the room Also the facial tissue and toilet paper were extremely cheap Although I did not require them extra pillows and blanket were not present You could probably request some of the above however I do not think you should have to ,0
 Horribly loud air conditioner Called desk to find out cost to call our car rental They told me no charge and then charged L9 each about 28 total for two calls when we got our bill They did take it off after some convincing Ridiculous charge for breakfast so we opted for local Starbucks ,0
 The cistern of the toilet dripped all night told staff but indifferent and wasn t fixed Overall the staff were unhelpful and tried to overcharge me No fridge even though provision for one was there Small double bed ,0
 Empty drinks bottle under bed lifts sign difficult to find and room signs arrows pointing wrong way did a circuit Needed to go in opposite direction to 254 than was on sign Mouse in bar ran up my seat ,0
 Booked six months in advance with specific requirements but which were ignored in fact hotel said they did not receive them from booking com Some staff less than helpful ,0
 Lifts far too small Didn t like having to use lift at Russell Square underground Bathroom very tiny could hardly move Shower screen didn t open so very difficult to use ,0
 A bit worn out single Windows our room was on 2nd floor on pub street side and some noice was coming Rooms on 2nd facing inside yard had a really awful view ,0
 Breakfast wasn t included in the price,0
 For 200 a night thought the room was a bit basic Couldnt sit on the toilet without banging into the sink Thought the bed wasnt the best Squeaked every time you moved,0
 For a four star hotel the room was tired and needed decorating the Furniture was dark and similarly tired the lightfittings needed replacing Room between bath and sink was minimal making it difficult to access sink Standard rooms very disappointing ,0
 Traffic noise from the street I was on the 3rd floor The overall feel of the hotel is a bit old Entry foyer felt dark and depressing Others would probably say it was atmospheric but it just felt a bit scuffed on the edges with thick paint job to hide the dings ,0
 Room size was smaller than expected The lighting was harsh with the overhead lights Bed and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable Our safe could not be fixed which caused us to put our valuables in the Managers safe very inconvenient ,0
 The room is like what they have in Italy I mean the single room is really small The overall cleanliess is OK I wasn t happy with the dust on the towel rack or the desk tho And the fact that a 4 star hotel doesn t have a fridge nor a scale in the bathroom was really annoying ,0
 The idea of free wi fi not being free after the first complimentary hour not clear at time of booking or booking in ,0
 Had issues getting into the wifi ,0
 The room is terribly run down My family has stayed at the Russell Hotel since the war and I have known it since the 70s I ve never seen it look so drab Assume it is cost cutting by a chain ,0
 The room they gave us was on the 1st floor no 150 it was a small room looking at the interior of the hotel It was s very dark room It had only 2 windows and you could look out only through the one The only thing you could see were machinery and there was a constant noise that did not stop at all day or night The elevator did not reach our floor we had to take about 12 steps as well I do not know if this room was given to us because we booked a value deal Anyway it was not cheap Also we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for the airport They told us it will cost 55 pounds We were 2 persons and we told them that we had 5 luggage 3 big and 2 small When the taxi driver took us to the airport he charged us 65 pounds because he said we had an extra bag In my opinion this is unacceptable I would not stay in this hotel again ,0
 I was put in a room with a tiny bathroom with an overhead shower It was not possible there to help my daughter who has a disability I have said about the disability in my request form It took 24 hours and a lot of my short holiday time to sort things out The initial receptionist s fault to give us a inappropriate room Please train them to be more sensitive to guests needs ,0
 for the rate I paid it wouldn t be fair to complain about something,0
 Not really that much of a problem but the bath takes up to much space in the bathroom so it is not so comfortable using the washing basin ,0
 The staff didn t speak english very well The junior suite was more like a double room and be sure to ask for a view to the square cause the air vent in the back yard will keep you awake all night The hotel itself need a bit of upgrade it s not a 4 star hotel ,0
 The hotel has seen better days The d cor generally was tired Various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use The room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on The staff were generally uninterested On early arrival I asked if I could have access to the room to get changed as I had cut my leg while travelling I wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it Two of the three staff members I asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury The third staff member offered me a Band Aid and use of the ladies toilets Its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle Five minutes in the room or any room and I would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue I particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room He implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while I m standing at reception bleeding I wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened I further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay They didn T Instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake I remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened Breakfast was average Service remained indifferent Not what I expect from a four star hotel I wouldn t recommend or return to it ,0
 wifi was rubbish only free for an hour bath was really small neither of us fitted in it ,0
 Toilet in bathroom was just not acceptable no distance between it and wash hand basin I really like a cup and saucer rather than a mug for my breakfast ,0
 Difficulty getting in to the hotel as no wheelchair access that we could find and a lot of steps ,0
 Wi Fi does not work very well ,0
 Would have liked a mini fridge and location of the hair dryer and iron was very awkward ,0
 decor a bit gloomy I paid 79 for the room yet was asked to pay a 120 deposit on arrival I don t like that ,0
 There were a few niggles the balcony window didn t shut properly and neither did the shower door but neither affected our stay and we slept great in a very cosy comfy room Bar was pricey but it is london I guess ,0
 I must admit I had higher expectations I feel I get so much more comfort and luxury for my money in other cities e g Berlin Paris Gothenburg a o,0
 Noise from big fans running all night from courtyard outside bedroom window kept us awake ,0
 Too many items missing every day E g no towels no water glass no toiletries no coffee Door key did not work for me or for the kind member of staff who came up tp help I was constantly ringing the desk or going down to ask for something necessary The staff could not have been more helpful but supplies were poor and something I needed was missing every day ,0
 Understaffing at reception means long waits to check in and check out ,0
 Loo flush wasn t very effective bit of an acquired skill Not enough plug sockets in room coffee terrible,0
 The room was the only let down It was very small and quite dingy The bed and bathroom was perfect although the window only opened slightly and there was a constant noise from a fan which was located above our window Definitely recommend upgrading your room if you get the chance ,0
 The bed was comfy but very noisy Every time I turned it woke me up ,0
 Didn t have breakfast included in deal therefore 12 if booked night before or 19 the day of it continental was in one area and cooked in another had better for half the price in an ibis ,0
 offered a cot 30 alternative was a 45 upgrade bar closed early despite residents and staff still there so offered room service at inflated price Our last experience was great this one poor Money grabbing up selling procedures in place to steal your last pound notes Lifts were too small ,0
 Humming noise in my room first night so I asked for a change In both rooms I had always to try the card key three or four times before it worked Temperature in old fashioned shower difficult to control ,0
 Bath and bath mat very slippy Even holding onto rail the mat slipped and I jarred my leg first time had hip replacement so a bit scary Warned family but daughter aged 14 also slipped hurting her leg and banging her head Also no toilet brush ,0
 not value for money room was noisy very dirty needed serious maintenace cramped with furniture definitely not the room shown on the internet site when making booking we will be telling anyone everyone not to go to this hotel including our travel agency contacts in various parts of the world Concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance ,0
 the hotel was rather tired and shabby around the edges needs redecorating and there was no hot water during the day but the staff did ammend my bill accordingly ,0
 TV not brilliant Bed not that comfortable for me anyway I prefer a hard bed Breakfast felt like I was in an exam hall ,0
 In evening about 7 pm they did not find anyone to get my luggage to the room,0
 Although notified an early check in I had to wait until 14 30 Overall aspect of the room is outdated,0
 No problems ,0
 Bathroom was small ,0
 We had a very smelly room with an unacceptable view of water pipes with green stuff all over there are no fridges so we ordered an ice bucket which after the ice melted turned out to be unclean and had tissues and garbage at the bottom the rooms were not cleaned as it is supposed to be and the wifi wasn t working until we got a voucher key At the end they charged us 200 GBP for smoking which they hadn t stated it was a non smoking hotel The bathroom spaces are horrible which we couldn t fit into the bathroom to just wash our face in the morning How are we supposed to pay a lot of money if we don t get any good service or a decent hotel room suitable for regular sized humans not skeletons I wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone I know unless I want them to have a bad time in london ,0
 Checking in and out was appalling I was told breakfast wasn t included when it was I also paid 100 cash deposit on checking in and when checking out was asked to pay in full again as they had no record Made to feel like someone who was trying to con them I have written to complain ,0
 The only let down with the hotel was breakfast we had it delivered to the room and it wasn t good raw egg isn t for me ,0
 when we first arrived we were asked of we wanted to pay on arrival or when we left we said when we left and were asked to leave a guarantee of a credit card which we dont have So we had a little trouble but paid for our first night in cash and paid the following morning for the next night ,0
 Some traffic noise but no more than you would expect in central London Shower temperature had a mind of its own I wanted to pay by debit card and the margin they tried to add to the bill to cover possible additional spend was excessive ,0
 I didn t walk into the room and have the same wow factor that I had when I approached the hotel There was large circle of damp in the celling which was a little off putting The view was disgusting At night it was very noisy from the central air conditioning units ex tractor fans that ran centrally through the hotel which was our view We did ask for an upgrade but there were no rooms available We reminded ourselves that we wanted the hotel for the location and not the room ,0
 Roomes dated flaking paint no biscuits small wardrobe plumbing makes terrible sounds when other people use there bathrooms keeps you awake or wakes you up in the middle of the night just very very tied there are better priced hotels in the same location ,0
 Room was tiny and poorly designed Bathroom had no shaving mirror and was very poorly finished some rotten wood etc Room smelled of stale smoke ,0
 Only issue was VERY firm mattress ,0
 Can t think of anything ,0
 Breakfast was average There were a lot of staff working at breakfast time but trying to order poached eggs from a member of staff proved a challenge each morning The lunch here is poor and very expensive If you are to stay here best to eat elsewhere ,0
 Paid extra 35 for upgrade as my wife birthday Room was large but refurb above caused a lot of noise at 8am and double glazing had 1inch gap so road noise was extreme After complaining when checking out manager offered 15 refund I complained we shouldn t have been given that room no response Also on first floor the metro can be clearly heard at 5am choose your room carefully ,0
 Noisy narrow rooms with huge airconditioning machines next to the internal part of the hotel that make increadible noice overnight Old windows without sound isolation ,0
 What I would suggest the hotel to look at long queues at the reception desk breakfast could have been better ,0
 bed soft and lumpy like most in England No satellite cable TV is a bit of an oversight ,0
 The bed was awful could not sleep because of the noise it made everything one of us moved The bathroom was small although had everything we required ,0
 i dont have any thing to say about this hotel it is full of happiness,0
 The room was tiny Smaller than my bedroom at home so was disappointed considering the price we paid Definitely not what I would expect for 4 stars Would have complained but got there late after a long journey so couldn t be faced with dragging all our bags back down to reception,0
 Room although I was told on check in recently refurbished was still tired looking and the Lighting is terrible Carpet old and scruffy looking Sorry would not return ,0
 Basic rooms and pretentious top hatted concierge ,0
 Had a room next to air conditioning unit even though requested a quite room staff were good andmoved usto another room ,0
 Not somewhere where I d like to spend time but a good place to crash for the night ,0
 Had to change rooms twice once because door key did not function and second time because the room was too small for two Very little space for clothes even in the final large room ,0
 Room had a drain smell in the bathroom ,0
 The hotel could do with looking at second glazing Poor fitting window very loud traffic sounds at night thus couldnot sleep very well ,0
 air conditioning unit was leaking It was reported to reception at approx 11 30 who said someone would be up to the room but no one appeared at all Beds were uncomfortable bathroom tiny ,0
 Recommendation from concierge for Verdi Restaurant Overpriced for mediocre food Saw Italian restaurant next to lamb pub that looked a lot better for similar prices ,0
 Room was shabby and needs the bathroom upgraded Very small bathroom and poor free toiletries Not impressed for 4 star hotel Disappointing,0
 We booked a suite intending that our young child would sleep on the sofa bed In the event it was too small and we asked that it be replaced by an extra bed This request was declined on health and safety grounds which appeared implausible An alternative but smaller room was offered with an extra charge for an extra bed which did not address the reason why the junior suite had been booked in the first place,0
 The room was tiny and on the day of checkout they told us there was no hot water after 09 30 which meant we had to get up and leave long before the 12 00 checkout time Probably a ploy on their part On Sunday we came back at 17 30 to change for dinner and found the room was still being serviced ,0
 Put at the back of the hotel above wher you have your deliveries the early morning noise was terrible also backed on to a public house which was also noises at closing time had poor sleep for the duration of our stay,0
 We had the window open by choice and were awoken by shouting and arguing in the square in the early hours of the morning,0
 Few more coffee and tea in room No tissues No conditioner Price of stay quoted did not include VAT on bill,0
 Steps at main entrance Bell staff is very helpful with luggage but impossible for ambulatory handicapped,0
 Breakfast was not included didn t realise and was very expensive 20 for a bowl of cereal Was also put in a room that smelled terribly of smoke and because it was the last room of its type was forced to upgrade my room which cost 20 night ,0
 This hotel is starting to look very grotty Carpets are stained and the cleanliness could be improved I have stayed for several years at Hotel Russel but having stayed in lots of other hotels it is definitely in need of some refurbishment Also the shower facilities are rubbish There is not even a shelf to place your bar of soap ,0
 I was charged 150 as pre auth on arrival and then next day I was charged the room rate of 99 so I have been charged 249 expecting only to be charged 99 which left me short during my stay This is unacceptable practice I have been advised that it will take 3 working days for the pre auth payment to be refunded which is a disgrace ,0
 We booked a standard room six months before with the idea that we would be allocated a good one However we were given one on the 6th floor with a tiny wardrobe small windows facing into a quadrangle and an even smaller washbasin As this was for our 50th wedding anniversary we were very upset and complained The response was excellent and the replacement standard room was so much better Management gave us a bottle of champagne and a cake to celebrate our anniversary Pity we had to complain though ,0
 not flexable in late checkout i have to pay 10 poounds per hour starting 14 00,0
 I ve stayed here twice and ever single time i get charged for a breakfast i did not have ,0
 small lobby area for relaxing uninspiring bar airco not effective in room ,0
 At one room service 2 Aug the service was a little slow probably because it was Sunday and I had no preserves ,0
 I would expect different varieties on the breakfast and the lack was the reason I didn t choose a breakfast ,0
 Small room breakfast poor,0
 If you want peace and quiet this is not the hotel for you Activity never ceases it is a very busy area ,0
 A little bit dark in the hotel and rooms ,0
 Our room 223 had shabby furniture well worn a job to get in and out of the bath needed another handle to get in I reported loos electric plug on electric iron ,0
 Booked a room with a view as read some poor reviews stating facing into a wall First room had a view but mould all round windows vile smell of damp Only available other room faced into a court yard of airconditioning units the air con did not work properly in room and couldnt open windows because of all the noise from units outside Was given a small electric fan and complementary bkfast as compensation but did not sleep due to heat lack of aircon and inability to open windows Only one hour free Wifi Would not stay in this hotel again Paid 70 for twin room ,0
 TV reception was poor but you don t go to London to watch telly ,0
 The only complaint I would make is that the windows would not open and also the plumbing in the bathroom bowl was a bit sluggish ,0
 Staff at reception were rude and are not welcoming at all on checkin The doorman was unfriendly it s quite ok to smile Room was smaller than expected and the tv screen was tiny It also did not work ,0
 The room was a little small for a 4 star hotel and the price we paid and the bed was very uncomfortable and creaked every time you moved ,0
 Staff seemed hard pressed and overworked Felt like we were stuck away and multiple attempts still kept us from getting enough room for three to comfortably share one room Promoting the location as being close to attractions that are over a mile away doesn t seem right ,0
 Staff member was rude at desk after 2 nights stay when our key cards stopped working Telling us we weren t doing it right After another member of staff came to our room to and apologised for other member of staff when realised it was the cards ,0
 Room on this occassion was a bit small Yoo much furniture in it step very near bed to bathroom could easily fall Would req larger room next time bathroom is small Bath very deep can b awkward to get in to ,0
 The outside of the hotel is far more majestic than its interior ,0
 Quite disgusted to find the Bathroom full of mold in a hotel ranked as a 4 stars hotel,0
 The air conditioner was like sleeping with a jumbo jet engine starting and stopping next to the bed Could not sleep with it on In our daughters room the air conditioner did not work at all and the room was very hot The room also smelt badly Staff changed their room the next day to an upgraded room at no extra cost The rest of the stay was comfortable ,0
 None,0
 We have stayed here a few times but some areas of the hotel are looking a bit tired we were initially initially in room 119 but requested to be moved after the first night due to being woken at 7am by building work going on outside this was dealt with in a very professional manner by the reception staff and we were moved into 130 which met with our expectations also you have a resident mouse that likes to frequent the bar fairly late in the evening on a regular basis ,0
 I would NEVER go backI have enjoyed better staff in 2 star hotels It is tired and needs quite a lot of money spent on it Having said that the dining staff and food were very good,0
 The room we stayed in was pretty small the decor very dated and it generally seemed a little shabby compared with the spectacular impression from outside ,0
 The fact that the air conditioning condensers are located in the middle of the hotel which means you hear a slight hum all night,0
 the scaffolding around the building was inconvenient,0
 Outlook was poor Bit overpriced,0

 Noisy rooms small poor breakfast wouldn t stay again,0

 The bathroom was very dated and in need of minor repair,0
 Extra bed was the worst breakfast queue was really terrible It s easy to tell people to come at a specific time though you have to arrange it somehow Parking is far away and hard to come back because of road diversions ,0
 I wish you had wheat free snacks,0
 Bit of a wait for a table at breakfast ,0
 Housekeeping would bang on your door to wake you up at 830am This is your alarm Very frustrated They will continue banging till you wake up until you told them not to clean up your room in such a morning hours Terrible If we need clean up we would put the paper sign out to make up room No respect on guests Don t expect this Housekeeping will refill your bath gel they only keep those bottles which you don t want to use keep on giving you the same unwanted bottles say conditioner They won t give you slippers cotton pads tho they keep it in their trolley They won t refill your tea sugar when u finished your stay was more than 6 days Doubt they changed your bedsheets too in such a long week ,0
 Breakfast was an absolute disaster 20 minute wait for a table que to get brerakfast and then a que to get toast by which time your breakfast was cold If you got the toast first and qued for breakfast you toast would have been cold No tea or coffee offered for 30 mibns,0
 Large queues for breakfast Room was very crammed booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children no space to go in with a pushchair Not enough lifts to cater for guests at times it took us 10 minutes to go down to the lobby restaurant ,0
 The room was spacious enough for a family because there is a sleeping sofa but when the sleeping sofa is unfolded the room door is blocked very small opening to enter the room,0
 Housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all Once when I returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet Also they won t give you enough set of towels Even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort They never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday The most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you But only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need E g I have 4 full bottles of conditioners 3 full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream They don t provide you with basic needs like slippers Cotton pads wools Q tips But we saw it in their trolley Not even refill teabags milk sugar Rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard ,0
 expensive breakfast especially when you only want a coffee and croissant We went to Starbucks around the corner for this ,0
 the traffic near the hotel was madness but that was likely due to the construction going on nearby once that is off the traffic will be better ,0
 Air con control in room did not work properly had to ask reception to turn it off as it was freezing despite turning it to 5 degrees Room very small for a 4 night stay Dispute at check out regarding bar bill all drinks paid for as taken but still had some charged to room ,0
 Slow elevators lots of wait time Breakfast downstairs not the same as Mezzanine and not as good ,0
 Two large bath towels No hand towels or washcloths Sink in bathroom about a foot lower than normal No tub no lip on shower area a wet room with water everytwhere No window to outside Electric went out at 1 30 am no air to our room temperature got to be extremely warm well over 90 degrees Interior room so it was pitch black Up all night staff very unpleasant and not accommodating No announcements or explanations made regarding blackout Very scary to be in a high rise in a city that s had terrorist attacks high rise fires and have a full power outage with no announcements No assistance or emergency lighting provided Manager would not refund night We left before stay was over The night manager was horrible ,0
 The room was very much smaller than I anticipated It must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as I checked in I had expected to have a small living area and that was why I booked this particular hotel as I did not want a traditional hotel room I did not get that ,0
 We had a leaky kettle they were light on with milk coffee in the room,0
 Apparently the hotel guests before us had replaced 2 of the minibar drinks with their own and as a result we were charged for the 2 drinks Not many cafes and food option nearby,0
 Leaking shower Electricity went out one night but we were compensated Temperature in room hard to regulate ,0
 Long delay to get into room even though I arrived after check in time Room was dirty London eye view wasn t proper as blocked by other hotel shouldn t have to pay for the poor view,0
 Very poor room cleanliness very disorganised housekeeping no towels in room on second day had to ask twice to get it resolved,0
 The bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old Also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower Secondly the beds are not comfortable enough The hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room Lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it ,0
 As a family of 4 with two young teenagers the room was a bit tight ,0
 Bath was too high to step into safely Glass screen was loose unsecured Not enough tea bags milk sugar When we phoned for more tea bags a handful of everything else other than tea bags was given to us ,0
 The sleeper couch which acts as the second bed was uncomfortable and not practical when open as it was in the way of the door ,0
 Was Not that Clean lot of Things like cushion Cover forgotten happened but staff was Friendly ans fast Breakfast queue,0
 Seemed slightly shambolic I checked in around 7pm and yet I was told I wouldn t have towels until an hour later although when I actually went to the room the towels were there but the bathroom just seemed a little ehhh I kept finding stray hairs around the place that didn t belong to me Bit gross ,0
 Milk in the room fridge Off Breakfast staff 3 days out of the 6 I had to ask for coffee No one checked me All other people couples were asked Perhaps a singles thing Otherwise all good Staff friendly and helpful Location brill ,0
 Since we booked studio room with 2 children the hotel did not provide extra sleeping pillows and blanket for the extra bed in the room ,0
 The only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened Not a problem with the aircon on but I like fresh air when I sleep The bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own The shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping I guess ,0
 The view from our room ,0
 The location was disappointing due to all the construction in the area which I was unaware of and which spoilt the view from my room I found the area very congested and noisy so would probably not use the hotel again I realize however that this is a personal preference and other guests may enjoy the area ,0
 The reception staff were really unhelpful and glum They never smiled Almost any request was too much trouble In a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key These appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed A poor reflection of the brand and hotel ,0
 I discussed my grievance with the duty manager who promised me she would address them upon checkout Upon checkout I was told she was busy however she would email me with her findings As of now now communication have been made ,0
 Room had a few damaged bits here and there Very clean though the bed was big but I found it as firm as the sofa bed in our room Air con seemed to be low in the day and fast and very cold in the early hours The other main issue was the lifts In busy times we waited 15 minutes as we had a baby buggy with us I had 1 gripe as I m quite OCD and don t like reusing towels i didn t receive the extra towels I ordered from housekeeping twice once each day ,0
 Small for a family of 4 A little over priced for what you get however expected for that time of year Not enough pillows House keeping knocked at our door fairly early which was disappointing as we just flew for 24hours ,0
 Air conditioning was a problem We had to let them know twice before it was handled Overall we very much loved our stay ,0
 Booked a double room but had two single beds pushed together with two single duvets being with my partner we weren t happy as we had to sleep separated due to this Also there is not enough milk coffee and sugar left in the room,0
 The breakfast was not how I expected it Also the breakfast staff on the restaurant was not as welcoming ,0
 I called the hotel to ask if I can pay the last night of our family stay by Maestro debit card and the hotel staff confirmed this is possible When we checked out appeared it is not possible not a huge problem but staff are giving incorrect information ,0
 Breakfast was a little busy Hit the peak you would wait but the staff laid out juice coffee for anyone in a queue Breakfast quality itself was excellent,0
 It s a family hotel so sometimes there are kids running around like it s a playground Apart from that all good,0
 There was not much options for the vegetarians in breakfast ,0
 Cleaners woke up us too early in the morning breakfast wasn t worth the money and the food hall was too small so we had to wait in line for quite a while bathroom was awkwardly placed in between beds and room wasn t big enough for two people to walk around at once and there was no bin ,0
 I was disappointed I emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted Everyone was confused However we were told in the end we could upgrade for another 100 00 pound a night which annoyed me We did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things The two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying In the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it Concierge was very good but depended who was on Breakfast was ok but really really busy Overrall I wouldnt stay again as I would rather be in the middle of the town We had to take a taxi to Oxford St all the time ,0
 The digging outside the Reseption But of course this will be finished ,0
 They need to provide slippers The fridge needs to be bigger To give you an idea of its size it could only fit two 1 5 liter soda bottles ,0
 Could have been more child friendly There were kids in the group that were 4 and six No facilities for children to play or be entertained ,0
 Small and very dark room ,0
 Sofa bed was terrible did not sleep whatsoever on the first night The bars were poking through the very thin mattress The amount of money paid for the accommodation I was expecting at least a comfortable bed Everything else was terrific The location and cleanliness A1 ,0
 Our first room was not to our liking We paid a reasonable amount for and upgrade the following day and we were much happier ,0
 Booked the hotel room one month prior to the check in date to get the the best price possible However I found out that the room rate went down considerably before my stay More than 350 GPB for 8 nights Communicating with the hotel management they did not agree to lower the price Booking com made a wonderful gesture keeping its promise of best price guarantee Booking com refunded me 352 GBP the difference in the price Thank you Booking com for keeping the promise ,0
 I did not like the bathtub with the shower The shower was difficult to use without getting water everywhere and the bathtub was difficult to get in and out of ,0
 Restaurant is dual purpose Good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff Breakfast very ordinary I am afraid Food from the cooked options cold Toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them Tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options Eggs Benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service ,0
 The sound proofing of the room is terrible and you could here everything outside the door and in other room The layout of the room is very strange with the bed just beside the door and living room at the end of the room The location of the hotel is ok it looks very close to the underground but actually need to walk 10min from the station Not impressed with the service of the staff either ,0
 They purposely not allowed my parents to check in one hour earlier since the room was ready The reason I wanted to check in earlier because my parents took a 15hours flight and need to take a rest before going out but the lady said the hotel policy stated check in time is at 3pm but before that she kept on allowing other customer non asian customer to check in I FELT DISCRIMINATED ,0
 It was a bank holiday so breakfast was not served at 6 30 AM as expected We had to wait until 7 7 15 AM so a rush to get to the airport for our early morning flight ,0
 Only one point toilet paper holder doesn t work the roll keeps popping out,0
 Disappointed by Bar staff was ignored for ten minutes bar was quiet and staff were chatting to each other and when I finally got attention and asked for half a lager I was told rather rudely that I d need to wait until my allocated waiter was free I waited for a few more minutes I had been walking in 35 degree heat and finally gave up ,0
 There was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this I would recommend asking for a room with a view I didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor The bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as I was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends ,0
 TV didn t work Poor lighting in room Poor toilet roll fittings No dressing gown or slippers Could have been cleaner Room had no privacy as overlooked by other rooms Also room overlooked restaurant Not up to 4 star rating Shower difficult to operate,0
 Room temperature and debris falling from the air conditioning ,0
 Getting woken twice up by drunken people shouting and hanging around in the corridor at 4am Not what you d expect with security about only sorted it once we called reception Bad night sleep ,0
 The traffic was a shambles outside the hotel,0
 There were no actual shops nearby I like to step out on the street and have things to look at We had to taxi to the main centre of London,0
 The room was a little hot during the night even with the air con turned right up as no windows that could open in the room,0
 Impersonal ,0
 Each day breakfast we had to ask repeatedly for a spoon for our coffee Sometimes we had to ask several times Even then sometime we never receive it Not impressive Major construction in front of the hotel It was loud with a lot of dirt and dust being thrown into the air Careful you don t get it in your eye or breath too deeply Everything else was good ,0
 poor wifi all staff were nice except Ramzi at the bar who was unwelcoming and seemed to hate his job ,0
 The tv in the bedroom was inset too far into the cubby where only one person can see the tv ,0
 the images they showed for executive studio city view while booking had a great city view and when i physically saw the room there is this hotel right in front blocking the view It wasn t worth spending the money ,0
 Crowded reception and queues Room 109 room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened Appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant,0
 We couldn t open the curtains in the morning because of the heat The airconditioner did NOT cope Hot I don t know how you could stay there if the weather was actually hot The view from our room was Waterloo Station ,0
 Noisy until 2 am Adults and children talking in the aisles slamming doors and no one from the hotel asked them to be more respectful ,0
 Cooked breakfast option was dreadful Bacon looked like it was mechanically shredded no rashers just bits Scrambled eggs tasted disgusting Beans were only warm Stuck to the much nicer fresh option Triple room flooded as soon as shower went on Spoke to reception who said she was unable to reduce the bill ,0
 Too many issues to get sorted with the room Bath plug not working no remote for the T V piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed Staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more There were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places ,0
 A bit of construction around the area,0
 Room wasn t cleaned very well during my stay cups were stained and they left my PJs on the table but despite this the place was quite clean overall ,0
 Would have appreciated a late check out say 3 00 pm for freshen up prior to train journey ,0
 Not enough shower gel body lotion etc Also I had to request our complimentary water it wasn t already in the room ,0
 Not for business travelers I requested a quiet room but was awoken by kitchen preparation resteraunt etc every morning and evening,0
 Strange layout with toilet in the middle of room with kitchen part and with sliding door didn t have much privacy Breakfast area over crowded and difficult to move around does not seem big enough for size of hotel and food not really fitting of the rest of the hotel,0
 All in all a great hotel ,0
 Would have preferred a room with a bath the room we were given was fine o list wanted to have a bath after walking so far ,0
 I liked everything ,0
 The hotel like many central London hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes We found one online at Upper Marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened There are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does Will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly ,0
 The room was a bit tired and the tea coffee facilities weren t replenished I had to ring up and ask It was delt with quickly upon the phone call,0
 Excellent location Very close to the London Eye and the Waterloo train station Unfortunately this 14 floor hotel has 3 very slow elevators Once it took me 10 minutes to reach my room at the 13th floor from the reception With the price they are charging it is simply ridiculous to have such an experience,0
 House Keeping should be able to speak and understand english as when i asked for something we coudn t communicate,0
 Bed a little hard and noise from the lift outside ,0
 Couldn t open the windows to the room to let in fresh air and the pillows were too thin which made the sleep difficult,0
 Receptionist attitude on checking in to be told they didn t have 2 rooms next to each other even though an email had been sent requesting this and a reply received back says no this had been noted and was no problems ,0
 I had to make an emergency phone call to Australia and my phone wasn t charging I asked staff they said of course I didn t think to ask of cost They charged me 100 pound for a 10 minute call disgusting ,0
 N a,0
 Breakfast was disorganised and needed more than one chef Queued for a table and breakfast staff seemed stressed and not that helpful No toilet brush in bathroom which could prove unpleasant with people sharing especially children ,0
 Bed was hard and squishy room 620 Tutorial for shower and lights would be helpful ,0
 The hotel was clean and presented very well but the bar area looked like it needed some updating the chairs and carpets were worn ,0
 as above breakfast was expensive an food quality was poor you get better food at school ,0
 Everything was great I thought we staying across the road which had a pool this one dident,0
 Service in bar a little slow but that s just looking for a negative really ,0
 L italiano restaurant was pretty poor which is a shame because the hotel was wonderful but other than that it was brilliant ,0
 hair dryer doesnt work i can ise just once if you are booked on booking com They will give worst room in hotel my room hasnt got any view bathroom isnt so bad,0
 No body answeing phone so i have to come down for any request I requested city view and i was promised to get it if available but when i reach i discovered that all twin room has inside view which i hoped if they told me before ,0
 We pulled out the sofa bed and used the extra blanket which had a large yellow stain on it and the extra pillows had some stains on the pillow casing ,0
 Considering the price you ve got to have a room overlooking outside ,0
 The fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well We had to use some of the towels to dry the floor Also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about 0830 to see if they could get in to clean the room Checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean Disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and I View from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms This was a shame as being on the 13th floor it would have been nice to have an external window,0
 Couldn t alight in front of the hotel as there was road construction blocking the front entrance,0
 We were 3 families and had 3 rooms One of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used The staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room They kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day They just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower They used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay The hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care The hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations They must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required The only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night ,0
 Construction near hotel makes it difficult for Taxi to arrive and depart and even walking road is difficult Not a fault of the hotel though I had requested for early check in but room was not ready which forced me to upgrade the room Hotel did not force situation forced me But the upgrade view was good with London eye Big Ben Westminster Abbey all visible from the room window ,0
 We wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the bar but they didn t have any that was cold as apparantly fridges were broken ,0
 The location of the twin rooms overlooking the inner courtyard very dark and gloomy this made us change to the next category room which was way better,0
 Lots of road works going on having to pay for the Internet also breakfast not included in the price expensive but in a good location ,0
 The bed was uncomfortable The TV was tucked in the corner of the room Front desk staff was unpleasant ,0
 A significant drawback was the sliding glass door of the bathroom which meant that anyone using it during the night woke everyone else up with the noise of the sliding door and the bathroom light lit up the rest of the studio very brightly A proper door would give much better privacy to everyone inside and outside the bathroom ,0
 Room was small for a superior room and poorly lit especially as it was an inside room and overlooked the inside wall of the hotel No view therefore needed better lighting within Restaurant tables were not well laid and had to go searching for cutlery at breakfast ,0
 It might have been useful to know there are roadworks ongoing outside the front entrance This didn t affect me as I was at the back but some customers might have been bothered by the noise ,0
 I found that the receptionists although speaking reasonable English were sometimes hard to understand and sometimes it was hard to make them really understand what it was you meant They were however always polite and helpful ,0
 house keeping kept the door to the room open after cleaning mattress felt little lumpy elevators take forever to come to the 14th floor esp in the morning maybe good idea to allocate an elevator for the top 3 floors only to avoid the over crowd reception staff are not so friendly even little rude and ignorant ,0
 We were there from Friday afternoon until Sunday and our room was not cleaned on the Saturday they did apologise and gave us fresh towels,0
 Hotel italian restaurand had automatic 12 5 tip added Small print bottom of receipt and i also left 5 for 56 meal so they got 12 for delivering 2 main courses Failed to mention when i gave extra money Disappointing,0
 Extractor fan in bathroom was on constantly irratating noise when trying to sleep Room was too hot air con was not working as it should ,0
 Dealt with above ,0
 The only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for The warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat ,0
 The room which we had was meant to be a family room the bed was fine but the children had a sofa bed which was the noisey as hell any time the kids moved in there sleep If squeaked so much ,0
 the bed was not that comfortable and the temperature of the room was very hot even when the gauge was set to low,0
 Food in the bar could have been improved I would have liked more choices for breakfast ,0
 The bathroom was a wet room but unfortunately when using the shower water spread across the whole of the floor so you could not use the other facilities until it had drained away which took at least half an hour ,0
 The drinks were slightly pricey but you have to expect that in London anyway ,0
 Staff at check out were a little inexperienced but always polite and trying their best,0
 The promised sauna steam room were not working I phoned the reception they said they were but when I went down they weren t and I wasted half an hour out of a tight schedule needlessly They also didn t respond to my complaint about it Very disappointing ,0
 We had a drink in the outside veranda at around 23 00 At 10 00 the following day our empty glasses were still where we had left them and the ashtrays were still overflowing Gives a very poor first impression as this is next to the entrance ,0
 The biggest thing is the lifts always when to top floor first and make its way down when it got to our level the lift was full most of the time making us wait longer for a lift ,0
 See above,0
 The bed and pillows are very soft which i did not like Also they need a good maintenance for the room facility and i wish if they can change the white lights with yellow lights to get the modern look of the room just an opinion ,0
 I felt the bathroom could be a little cleaner Because the chrome in the bathroom was not polished up by that I mean just a wipe over with a micro fibre cloth it made me look closer and the bathroom shower cubicle especially taps ect could of been cleaner it was a shame that something so simple let it down for me ,0
 smell of drains sewer in bathroom brekfast too crowded tables too close and knocked by people children pushing past hotel not received booking regarding children,0
 Room was a little small and the room window looked at the inside of the hotel,0
 There wasn t anything we did not like this was our 3rd visit to this hotel and it has been great each time we have stayed ,0
 Loads of roadworks around entrance made access on foot tricky Couple of sidelights in room did not work Shower controls a bit of a mystery ,0
 Stayed 4 days with my family for the London Marathon Not a good experience The hotel is always crowded and not relaxing Rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed In the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed Satellite TV always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions The first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true Queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators The queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that I was with my parents who had to wait 15 mins standing before sitting Inaccurate room cleaning One day room was made at 16 00 the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap The next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes The first day they started to knock at the door for service at 8 in the morning with people still in the room Breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel Staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions Location near Waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate Beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street To find some bars Overall this hotel was a terrible choice ,0
 We booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him We paid a lot to stay there and brought another 2 couples with us and I just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and I would think twice about dining there again Other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful ,0
 I did not like breakfast at all Except the omletes cooked by chief Restoran for the breakfast very small so creates long waiting list in front of restaurant ,0
 Not happy with the service in the Italian resteraunt very slow Automatic service charge added even though it took over 2 hours for 2 course meal of which the one of the courses was a cold starter People that were seated after us were served preferentially,0
 The room is a bit dated The fridge is a bit too small since a large part of it was locked ,0
 The double room was very small with two twin beds and very little room Given the price this was not worth it The breakfast was nice but cost additional 20 pounds per person Also requested a 1 hour late check out and was charged an additional 10 pounds per room Seemed unnecessary ,0
 At peak times the queue line for breakfast could be long but either the family room would be open additional seating upstairs or the line would move fairly quickly ,0
 I wouldn t recommend this location for travelers with cars as parking is difficult and the London Congestion Charge is prohibitive The breakfast lines were a little long but the staff managed very well and kept everyone happy and the breakfast was good ,0
 Room cleaning could be improved ,0
 Upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing No external view as requested even though I know not guaranteed Our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal Had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view I would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view A nice few days spent in London however would not stay at this hotel again ,0
 Very tricky getting a reasonable gluten free breakfast despite putting it in the details and phoning ahead Took 3 attempts to get something and several incorrect rounds of information being given despite a 3 year old being coeliac and waiting patiently for his gluten free food Balcony was lovely but it appeared to be the only one missing outside seating which is a missed opportunity given the view Room was a little tired and worn decor wise but a fab size ,0
 Could hear people walking about the floor,0
 Room I booked was small and dark with no outside window In my opinion it was misrepresented on booking com We would not have been happy there for 5 days ,0
 Have stayed previously and room was excellent This time it was far too hot even after the maintenance had attended Had to keep curtains closed as air con couldn t keep the room at normal temp ,0
 Breakfast although nice and plenty of choice was far too expensive cheaper and better choice at local restaurants and bars,0
 It took some time for the cleaning service to do the daily cleaning,0
 Air conditioning noisy no ventilation room to hot Room service meal only warm Breakfast disappointing queuing for table then table reset as collecting self service meal Selfservice meal warm mushrooms and tomatoes cold ,0
 Had to alert maintenance twice on issues which housekeepers should have picked up on and rectified before my arrival Faulty lamp in bedroom and faulty shower head This was POOR Both issues were resolved swiftly and efficiently upon request however Had to alert reception that I was being charged for breakfast on both nights of my stay as my rate quoted was inclusive of breakfast This was POOR ,0
 I purchased the breakfast package but there was limited seating and a long line for breakfast We ate there twice and it was fine but I was disappointed not to be able to take advantage of something I had paid for ,0
 Strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station Poor breakfast service queuing for 45 minutes before gettting a table in a conference room Being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast Poor quality of food especially bread We had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set ,0
 Please clean the windows Since there where so many kids staying at the hotel there should be an entertainment room for them The breakfast room is too small and is a pity that there isn t i a coffee machine ,0
 Standing in line each morning for breakfast was poor not enough tables to support hotel Seemed to stand forever waiting on lifts to and from room level Prices in bar where over the top and had the cheek to charge me 12 5 service charge serving me a beer over the bar ,0
 Warmer welcome would ve been better Appreciate 3 tired dirty but polite workmen walk in to reception may offend But think my money is as good as anyone elses Breakfast was poor especially grey bacon left in bains marie or combi too long Plaza opposite Westminster Bridge much better,0
 The breakfast buffet area was too small We were disappointed about no pool ,0
 The elevators are so slow and everyone is upset about it Every morning there is a long waiting line for breakfast very frustrating to wait about 20 min for a table ,0
 Overall the stay at Park Plaza County Hall met my expectations The only inconvenience was the lifts It felt like you were waiting quite a while for lifts to call at your floor ,0
 Parents room quite small no view they were looking into middle of hotel bathrooms could be improved very big step to get over into bath and no lock on bathroom doors ,0
 Room was probably a bit smaller than expected and the staff were generally very good breakfast area was a bit crowded and the breakfast tables and seats were very close together breakfast service was a bit hap hazard particularly when queueing for eggs,0
 one of the hotel stuff ruined our bag by mistake they didnt offer any compensation,0
 Restaurant is very unexciting and feels a bit like a cafeteria Bar area unexciting too Felt this was a shame as did not encourage use of either ,0
 City view through Waterloo railway not nice at all limited number of adapters available at reception early breakfast recommended or longer waiting time ,0
 Breakfast was average with some of the food a bit bland Lifts were terrible and expected better but overall a good stay,0
 The breakfast option seemed good but we didn t book it as it was too expensive per person Perhaps more pricing options would have encouraged us to take breakfast in the hotel ,0
 the breakfast is so basic for its price The food assortment is very limited for the price of 20 pounds I can go and have much better breakfast in the cafe I also recommend to come earlier for the breakfast because the restaurant is not big and possibly you will have to wait for the table,0
 there was no welcome water bottled at the room and there was no black tea in the mini bar the TV is located in one side and it hard to watch TV from the other bed side ,0
 Room 1024 and the filthy windows which were so dirty you couldn t see out of them Staff were happy to show us alternatives but perhaps it would be better to employ a window cleaner ,0
 We were able to hear our neighbours which was a bit offputting Also we could hear the restaurant noise as it was directly below us We didn t take advantage of the breakfast which we were glad of as the queue for breakfast was very long at 8 30 am ,0
 Wardrobe inside light was not going off when closing the doors so was lit all night Poor views from our room though just used it for overnight mostly WIFI poor speed ,0
 Rooms were sometimes not made during the day Restaurant was not big enough to cope with breakfast,0
 This room was not worth 200 night I believe that the Premier Inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities The amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room The wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for 2 room guests The bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force In this case it could result in that person sustaining injury I would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom ,0
 Room cleaning was great when they did it But there were a couple days we came back from being gone all day and they hadn t gotten to our room yet Not a big deal but worth mentioning,0
 Breakfast could have been better coffee was very poor on the 3 mornings ,0
 Some of the bathroom towels were frayed and worn looking ,0
 The cost was a bit too expensive but considering the location I ll make an exception The noise of people opening and closing doors was immense Also the sound of water running through the pipes from upstairs was very loud It was evident everytime someone flushed the toilet The sound proofing needs a bit of work to say the least Lack of USB chargers in a modern hotel is questionable ,0
 The fact that you couldnt open the windows unless you was on pent house level was misleading I did not like this at all THe temperature in the room was constantly boiling even if heater was off I asked to move room and turned out I couldnt as none of them have windows Not good ,0
 Reception for my mobile phone,0
 A picture is worth a thousand words Added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central London and what you see through your window if you can after paying about 200euros per night in a 4 star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right Needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at 7 30 am in the working days Sure they do have double glazed glasses but I am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation Seems no one reads or cares what is written there In the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages Housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed After all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary We will never step in Park Plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and I will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them ,0
 We had an internal view quite disconcerting Would have requested to change it had we stayed longer,0
 It was very very pricey to stay here The breakfast on day 2 had a long line and it did not seem that they had an organized plan to seat people for breakfast ,0
 I wish the staff could speak better English I found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster I m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc A small thing but annoying ,0
 Because we stayed six days and ate the breakfast on site every day because we paid for the included breakfast it would have been nice if they had changed up the menu from one day to the next It would have been really great if they had offered French Toast pancakes or waffles sigh But that said we had no problem with being seated right away as some reviewers have And the food was fresh and hot with plenty available ,0
 The room size was smalle the temperature in room very hot there is no buses or tubes stations neer from hotel The waterloo station 10min walking from the hotel The hotel doesn t provide room dining 24 hours and just one restaurant in the hotel which is italian restaurant ,0
 The rooms was not big enough for 2 or 3 persons We asked for 3 beds but did only get 1 bed and 1 crap sofa The WC dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy ,0
 Hard to find anything wrong My single room was tiny but this is normal for Central London ,0
 HD TV was confusing and I am not convinced was working properly That is ITV1 continually showed a Sky trailer I could not get any ITV1 programs TV guide was also not working ,0
 The shower didn t work and wasn t looked at until the 2nd evening of our 2 night stay after we spoke to reception the afternoon of our day of arrival the following morning and afternoon The room was incredibly hot despite also informing reception of this on the 3 occasions we complained about the shower We were told the room temperature was controlled by computer and that it would be adjusted This was never done I was also given a discount card and told I could use this for a 5 discount on the hotel bar and restaurants When I purchased a rum and ginger at the bar I was told this discount was for soft drinks only and charged the full 9 90 for my drink that s not a typo it was nearly 10 ,0
 1 Frontdesk is soso I asked for an adampter wehn I checked in and was told I have to come tomorrow morning 9 00am When I came eary in the following moring they said it is first come first get and dont have any So I have to buy one in B1 Suggest the hotel to tell the client clearly what you can help and if you can t let us know as well 2 The price is higher compared with its service ,0
 The underground Waterloo is very busy between 8 30 9 00 am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can We arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location She just did not care at all But this is the case in all London hotels I ve noticed Specially with the east European staff members Their accent showed through The sighing especially so rude Spending 200 a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons Only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted As a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying ,0
 Our superior twin room was small and dark overlooking a narrow internal courtyard which meant that we had to have the light on at all times of day Not very comfortable and not good value ,0
 I requested a higher floor room but assigned a 1st floor room In the room the door s inside key was broken so could not lock The bed was terribly hard and I had a backache next day ,0
 The airconditioner was warm and I found out just on the last night when I asked for a fan that the temps can be dropped by the staff It would have been nice to know that is advance pre authorization on your CC is needed in advance if u want to order room service Should be part of the initial CC pre authorization I shouldn t be paying each time I order something ,0
 Not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position ,0
 The burger was a bit scary Other in our group had the chicken burger which was ok I requested a late check out the night we checked in The receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of 10pnds an hour I called in the morning at 8AM to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room After that there were 5 phone calls through out the morning up until 11 30 A little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience 5 hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible ,0
 Had to wait 3 hours for our room Ordered delivery and had to go downstairs in my pajamas to get it The shower water overflowed into the kitchenette area and then all the way into the bedroom Our entire room was soaked The room was freezing the entire time despite the heat being on the maximum level ,0
 The sofa bed was hard The pillows were far to soft and useless as when you put your head on them they disappeared and gave no support bring your own Room far to stuffy and hot air con made it hotter if stayed longer would have complained about heat,0
 Children s sofa bed was very uncomfortable Frosted glass bathroom door didn t afford much privacy ,0
 No milk in room for drinks Shower unable to regulate temperature Although I asked for twin as I stayed with my son the 2 beds were positioned too close like a double bed Much too tired to complain that evening as we were late checking in and just wanted to sleep,0
 I booked reservation fee days before arriving date After I checked in I found the price was dropped a lot However booking still charged me the original price I booked I hope booking is able to alert customer Wht the recent price is ,0
 I had to wait for my room to be ready even though I d arrived late afternoon and also I had to wait for a table at breakfast ,0
 N A,0
 Didn t like coming home because had a great time ,0
 Valet parking should be cheaper hourly rates which then would create more business UK needs to adopt free valet parking and get away from the system what is deemed as luxurious and get with the times ,0
 A solid door on the in room bathroom instead of a sliding frosted glass door Had to pay for wifi ,0
 When I booked I requested a room on a high floor with good view We got a room overlooking a building site The hotel said you had not forwarded this request I was very disappointed as I had booked last year Felt let down ,0
 Pillows far too soft didn t sleep too well a nasty smell of stagnant water in the bathroom,0
 No complaints,0
 Rooms facing the lift suffer severely from the noise of the safety locking mechanism I relocated Wifi throughput erratic TV cables and remote had been removed by an earlier guest helpful and well meaning but not very efficient staff took 2 days to fix this Spa sauna steam room tiny have to ask for facilities to be switched on For 240 per night I would have expected the breakfast to involve something like an omelette without surcharge Little things like lights hinges taps would benefit from some adjustments ,0
 Rooms too hot at night ambient temperature too high and felt putting air conditioning on in March a waste of money and not very environmentally friendly ,0
 The walk in shower was not well designed Water went everywhere every time you had a shower However it wasn t a major problem ,0
 Central located hotel close to amenities public transport and various forms of entertainment The staff were professional and friendly ,0
 scary open elevator ,0
 The bathroom had a frosted glass door with no lock which may be off putting for some people ,0
 I thought breakfast was a little too expensive my only dislike ,0
 Bed was not ok Bad comfort bad sleep tired during stay Airco was not good way to hot in the room Staff member treatened my girlfriend as a prisoner because she did not had the room card with her ,0
 The bed was very low which if you are over 6 foot tall was disconcerting ,0
 I still feel the cost for the hotel was expensive and we will not use it again ,0
 Every Morning Especially our last morning the house keeping would call very early to clan the rooms and wake us up on our last day they knocked at 8 45 am,0
 1 Bath room is not cleaned After room cleaning a lot of hair can be still found in the sink 2 Every Evening after whole day visit find the room card doesn t work Each time i have to go down to the reception for validation even i have paid all my stay 3 We live in the family room but they only give bathgel and shampoo for max 2 persons Every Evening i have to call for extra for rest of the family ,0
 the breakfast was lovely with plenty of option just the scrambled egg was nasty very rubbery and bland,0
 Wasn t happy with the main shower head not working properly coming out at different angles and water ended up on the ceiling and the floor making it very dangerous to walk on,0
 The sofa bed was not that clean so I phoned the reception asking for cleaning the bed and the cleaning staff came but they were not nice I waited for the lift for around 15 mins 3 lifts are not enough ,0
 breakfast was not included and really should had been for the price i paid ,0
 When we arrived our city view consisted of the train station next to the hotel Asked for a room with a proper city view and the only available room was the penthouse at cost Decided to upgrade and it was worth every penny ,0
 Carpet was a little shabby and bathroom had seen better days but these are not cheap or easy fixes The room was internal and the only window faced onto the Restaurant so there was no natural light Not a problem for me pitch black makes me sleep like the dead but my sister wasn t keen But for only 2 nights it was perfectly liveable ,0
 Just need reception staff to work on their grasp of understanding the customer It took a few attempts to make myself clear,0
 The room was to hot and the air conditioning system would not respond to the settings As it was only one night we put up with it But had our stay been longer we would have had to complain ,0
 I made a book at booking for two adult and one 10 year old when coming to the hotel I had to pay extra for the child Not OK,0
 Lack of parking mitigated by valet service which however costs 45 for 24 hours which might put off some people ,0
 Lack of extra pillows Our room smelt when we first went into it wasn t pleasant We waited 15 minutes for a lift and ended up taking the stairs Our room keys kept failing to let us in our room we must of had them re programmed 4 times When we returned to our room about 11pm there were children playing football in the lift area near the restaurant which I thought was really bad as no staff seemed to be stopping them I requested early book in but was not given this although they stored our bags for us which helped I wouldn t stop here again for money we paid ,0
 First room wasn t ready Came into a dirty room and the beds had no sheets ,0
 The room did show some wear and tear e g loose tiles on the bathroom floor ,0
 Everything was fine Always enjoy staying here,0
 Appalling breakfast organisation poor quality food items staff couldn t care less when complained at time curtains hanging off end of rail bathroom wiped clean but encrusted deposits around fitments there was more but they re not worth my time,0
 Service completely incompetent Unhelpful Only room service staff knew what to do The rooms were dirty The amount of dust in the wardrobe was shocking I have never seen something like that in Ta room which costs 250 a night in central London ,0
 I was in room 1224 I think and the elevator outside clicks and clocks like a gun every 5 10 minutes But shabby to be honest I don t like gun s I am comparing your hotel to the park plaza Victoria in Amsterdam That hotel is top banana ,0
 Would have liked a table and a second chair in the room Because the settee was used as a bed for our stay we hadn t enough furniture to relax on ,0
 Sofa Bed uncomfortable for children short wait for a table at breakfast ,0
 Queue for breakfast although it was only 5 mins it s hard with young children,0
 The gym equipment was OK but not as high standard as the rest of the hotel however it had a gym which is unusual for a London hotel in this price range ,0
 Everything else I booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week The stay was for myself and my parents I havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before I get married Firstly booking com has advertised the room I was booking with a picture of the room with a view to London Eye or Big Ben Did we get that view Not at all And we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door My mom is disabled so I went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect So they changed our room to a Junior Suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station I have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to Big ben or London eye which they said is not their fault and theres the Shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the Shard is in the city this is the City view You can say that pretty much about anything I appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until I realised that the Spa bookings I have made for myself and my mother have not been made Complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay There were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof I have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes The next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again I have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life ,0
 We are a family of 4 on arrival first day complementary toiletries not enough had to call house keeping for more Second day was out most of the day sight seeing got back at 5 15 room just cleaned left us with 2 towels only no toiletries had to ring house keeping again ,0
 Found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed Unfortunately they didn t sleep very well We had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel ,0
 The fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you I found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that I paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so I paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund ,0
 The key cards weren t that great found ourself standing there for ages to try and get in to our room also the room was very hot Even with the aircon on lowest temp so didn t sleep that great,0
 Breakfast Area often overcrowded room requires some maintenance Carpet Soap Holder in Shower House Keeping was often done relatively late ,0
 A little busy so had to queue for breakfast but was half term and guidance is given on busy times Ate breakfast in ground floor bar area on second day but food was a little cold ,0
 Staff at the reception wasn t helphul at all Was asked to pay although had paid for the stay the evening before After explaining my situation she requested a different card Being not very fluent in English I couldn t properly defend my position after what she asked my nationality and told me you can go Very surprised that a central London hotel can be so rude and insensitive Deep disappointment and unpleasant feeling for the rest of the day ,0
 We booked a studio with a double and sofa bed The sofa bed is so bad I literally went to a e with severe neck pain Do not sleep on the sofa bed Also very surprised that no Ow came to clean the room until 6 pm We had been out since 8am ,0
 Limited channels at TV Limited sugar for tea hahaha And very limited milk It was not which we was expected for the value which we paid,0
 Useless staff in Bar We had to ask five times if we could order drinks Each time they said they would take our order at our table The final time we insisted they took our order at the Bar but still no one made any effort to organise drinks It wasn t busy I have no idea why the four staff were unable to provide an adequate service It was bizarre ,0
 The rooms have no windows and very much dislike the air conditioning The rooms are too hot and not comfortable which meant I didn t sleep until 3am You can hear the lifts all night and they are noisy and I m a light sleeper Also every time I ve been to the hotel my room is never ready much preferred the park plaza hotel across the road ,0
 Room was too hot could not get the temperature down,0
 The rooms were not ready on time at 2pm The queue for breakfast Not complaints just points to note ,0
 A couple of little niggles Fridge part of the minibar wasn t cold enough and the room was too warm despite having the air con on max Perhaps it being so cold out meant they turned the heating up ,0
 The temperature of the hotel our room wouldn t warm up even after putting the temperature to max Also the microwave wasn t present in the room as was expected to be included ,0
 Queuing for the restaurant at breakfast On checking out at midday decided to have a coffee in the bar area but the staff were still clearing away tables from breakfast Seemed to be in no great rush This wasn t the case when I last visited last year,0
 Paid for upgrade to see London Eye Big Ben Eye was fab view couldn t see Big Ben did complain and got half of upgrade fee back if you want to see Big Ben too need higher than 7th floor Also for price we paid would have been nice to have breakfast included An additional 20 a head didn t seem fair when spending over 200 on a room ,0
 Shower creates a bit of a puddle as the door didn t shut properly,0
 I paid for an executive suite with city view as it stated on the website What I got was a room on the 11 th floor overlooking the side of the Park Plaza Westminster across the road and part of the construction site from Waterloo train station Very unhappy about this I was told at reception I could look forward to a great view from my room the windows were filthy to so good luck taking any photos of your stunning view James quirk,0
 Minor things that I wouldn t even put the hotel down over it was our personal preference ,0
 Room was a little too hot even when air con was in cold,0
 Additional beds for kids sofa bed was very uncomfortable and smelled because of humidity Air conditioning was bad too no fresh air can be found inside building ,0
 check in staff not helpful lobby small and therefore always crowded Breakfast room feels like a fast food restaurant Far too small when hotel is full especially with families They call it executive rooms although there was no executive lounge Elevators too slow for number of guests Have stayed often in London but this was the least appealing hotel There are certainly many better options ,0
 Poor cleanliness very bad Wifi connection The bed is uncomfortable it really hurts my back and nick Very slow service Breakfast asking for extra money to get something like omelet So I cancelled,0
 Danish pastries croissants at breakfast were cold would have been nice if warm or if there was a way to heat up,0
 The only thing I didn t like was the fact that I had to come home ,0
 We paid for Internet and the tv kept says No signal so we were unable to use it Other than that our experience was amazing We would definitely visit again ,0
 Dressing gowns were tatty and too small Towels too looked a little tired Bed seemed hot due to plastic cover ,0
 Not enough lifts which means if you are on one of the upper floors then be prepared for waiting up to 5 minutes for one to arrive ,0
 20 30 min queue to get to breakfast both Saturday and Sunday we did not arrive at the same time is not acceptable to a 4 star hotel Our room was not cleaned after the first night until we asked for it around 5 30 in the afternoon ,0
 Breakfast had to queue for about 20 minutes and then when we did sit down had to queue again for hot food which wasnt being replenished very quickly so choices were limited not good value,0
 The duvet It was too thick heavy and very lumpy Made sleeping uncomfortably hot ,0
 The most awful hotel that i have ever lived in The staffs were not friendly and nobody helped us with our luggages when we checked in till we asked The heating in the room was either extremely too hot or too cold We couldnt adjust the temperature in our room We had to call to the reception to let people do it over and over again We stayed there for three nights and none of the nights were comfy Definitely not worth for the money that we paid Very disappointed We would not choose this hotel again and we are not recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
 Overpriced for New Years eve paid 400 per room per night and when asked if we could have a room facing the fireworks they wanted another 800 per night Total extortion dirty small and below average room Wouldn t pay more than 40 a night Had to take 3 small children outside to watch in the freezing cold at 11 30pm because they would not let us have a room facing the fireworks Rooms were empty because people refused to pay 800 they wanted ,0
 Leave ahead at least a day for your laundry cos the dryer will take at least 2 rounds 2 5 hours per round to do your clothes half dry ,0
 The room wasn t ready when we arrived at 4 00pm Our room should have been available 2 00pm The sofa bed was not very comfortable ,0
 The beds were way too soft to my liking the shower switch wasn t working housekeeping seemed to forget their items in the room for 2 nights I stayed there ,0
 Arrived a little early for check in and the room wasn t ready they took our bags and said I would be contacted by Txt message when room was available no sign of a text by 1 30 PM so called up to the desk and room was ready room was small fixtures and fittings were poor tap was falling off the sink ,0
 At fisrt the sofa bed was broken but we get change to another room,0
 We were a group of friends and the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable you could feel the springs through the mattress,0
 We were 2 parents and child The added fold up bed was positioned where you would expect the fixed bed to be and vice versa The elevators seem to be insufficient for the large number of rooms When checking out it was very difficult to actually make it down to recepcion because every time the elevator passed it was already full with people And no matter how nice a hotel might be when it s time to go it s time to go ,0
 Response to queries I didn t get any Requested a room with a view when booking and in a follow up email as it was the first time in London for my children Appreciate it may not always be possible but just didn t get any response Also asked for information about family activities on follow up email as this is mentioned on the website again no response Disappointing ,0
 We had to wait around two hours after the time you could check in because our room wasn t ready ,0
 the bed is not comfortable the breakfast is always crowded limited options opposite to what was mentioned we had to wait for in long ques for a table for breakfast sometimes we were offered to have have breakfast in conference meeting rooms in another floor so as not to wait we were told that the breakfast is the same which was not as there was items in the main restaurant but not where we had our breakfast however they played cartoons which was amusing for the kids ,0
 Didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the London Eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel Also that the bathroom sink was blocked The burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments No Ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another 25 mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold Very Poor Also the pasta in the Italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order ,0
 There were no face wash cloths provided this was a challenge No onsite variety store selling basic vacation items such as varied drinks confectionery items vacation supplies likely to be required ,0
 The room Inside room with view of the dining room Could not open the window Could not control the air conditioning Was advised the morning after our stay that we needed to ask reception if we needed cold air as it was controlled from downstairs The tap on the bathroom sink was very loose The tap on the bath was very stiff the setting was programmed for hand shower use so my friend got quite a surprise soaking when she tried to turn on the shower and one of the turning spikes handle broke off in my hand when I tried to turn it Could not control the water temperature so ended up filling the bath from the hand shower unit with boiling water and taking a bath when the water cooled down Advised reception of the issues after breakfast and 2 plumbers came up to the room straight away where they proceeded to tighten the sink tap and look at the shower bath controls Both agreed that they were not right They also pointed out that there was no visibility of the hot cold bath shower info on the taps as this appeared to have rubbed off We spoke to the manager who offered to refund our breakfast but not the cost of the room Cannot fault the staff polite and efficient but a little disappointed that no refund part refund was offered The front of house manager gave us his card and advised me to email these details on our return ,0
 There were a few lights in the room that just wouldn t turn off so it was illuminated even during the night Also the wardrobe handle just fell off the first time opening it No major issues though ,0
 The shower easily overflowed The mattress topper had gone lumpy ,0
 Room was quite cold only air conditioning was available and not needed considering its winter Buffet breakfast was nice but area is too small considering the number of people we saw each morning Luckily with a 6 year old we were early for breakfast only saw queues on leaving Tables very cramped and area cold with lobby doors constantly being opened Small things i noticed were no facecloths in bathroom or cleaning liquid cloth for kitchenette ,0
 We were promised a room with bath and kitchen but did not get this There was no kettle even in the room until we requested one We chose this hotel which was not really as convenient as we would have liked specifically for this reason On complaining we were offered our last night in the room we had requested An offer we did not take as it was too late to pack and unpack for one night ,0
 Ripped duvet cover Shower was rubbish no more that a trickle We had to queue for breakfast we were located in the bar on the lower floor as the restaurant was extremely busy we had tiny tables and it was was freezing not happy about this at all ,0
 1 Food choices of breakfast are too limited,0
 Reception staff We paid in full upon arrival and got charged the entire amount 3 times again They were argumentative and refused to believe us so we had to show them our account statement We also got charged small random amounts each day and there were 8 extra things on our mini bar bill that we didn t have It was lucky we checked the charges They refused to be at all apologetic or seem empathetic ,0
 Room was very compact for 2 people If we had been a hurry to get out it is difficult for 2 people to not keep running up against each other The big heavy glass sliding door on the bathroom was noisy to move ,0
 I have stayed in this hotel many times but on this occasion I got one of the smaller rooms Didn t like the glass door on bathroom ,0
 Room felt slightly damp ,0
 I was a little put off by the style of the bathroom door translucent glass slider because it didn t allow for as much privacy as I would like I also wished they had mentioned at check in that you use your key card to activate the light switches because it took us a few minutes to figure that out when we got in Maybe they said it and we missed it ,0
 The advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself The Check in was delayed by about 15 minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room Very poor check in and unproffessional No sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water There is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with The access to the internet on the tv is blocked Very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price ,0
 Toiletries were a bit scarce 1 bottle of each for a family of 4 is a bit too little had to ask housekeeping for more every time which they provided with no problems,0
 More choice of films on tv,0
 Ground coffee and a biscuit would have made it better ,0
 Booked for New Year s Eve spent 2660 for two rooms two nights because told London eye view London eye view bull had to go outside and stand in street after bought tickets home page shows London eye they wanted another 2000 pound to upgrade shocking,0
 Booked executive suite with view but the view we got was rail way station which was a bit disappointing Was hoping for river eye view Also there were 3 of us staying there but only given 2 cups wine glasses etc and when we called room service reception to request another glass we were told it was on its way but never arrived ,0
 the staff were a little slow but vert polite so no faults ,0
 We ordered room service after waiting an hour for it they missed the milk for our tea and the pizza Base was doughy We were left to it at breakfast and had nearly finished before we managed to get some ones attention for a warm drink Then they only brought us one and not two When checking out we never got the option or chance to give any feedback about our stay ,0
 The amenities in the room such as plates and utensils are not properly washed before being placed back in the cupboard The bathroom sink was clogged the first day we came in The bed is not very comfortable back support is not adequate There is not enough room for breakfast,0
 Literally no wardrobe space We stayed for 4 nights and had to leave our clothes in suitcase Not sure it was value for money over New Years Eve The hotel decided to charge 109 00 for the buffet in restaurant on New Years Eve which I felt was cashing in on the whole event They wanted to charge an extra 700 for view upgrade which I thought was cashing in Bar very small no where to relax once a few families are in the bar ,0
 When we booked hotel back in Jan 16 we requested room with a view of London eye In November had email to say our room did not have a view We could upgrade for 300 a night Unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount So we had no choice We were on Level 4 and waited on average 20 30 minutes for 1 of 4 lifts Really bad On arrival we were offered Breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on First morning there was a que of about 45 minutes for a seat in the dining room Not what I would have expected for this class of hotel ,0
 That fact I booked a penthouse suite for New Year s Eve on the basis we had a view of the London eye based on the images used booking com On arrival we were advised that our room was south facing meaning we had no view of the fireworks what so ever,0
 There seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and Booking com We arrived on Christmas day and the hotel was fully booked Upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though I specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children I even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this The staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue Eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the 14th floor which was great The troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast ,0
 Ridiculously overpriced Couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page Staff unfriendly and unhelpful Included breakfast was basic boring and cold Bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature Laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for 2 months There for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day Bed not made properly Dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish Would not recommend this hotel to anyone Email I sent still unanswered ,0
 Management is arrogant and unhelpfull Breakfast queues of half an hour way to small restaurant for busy times prebooked and confirmed room not there Reception is eager to add costs ,0
 Our check in was delayed 3times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many London hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold Sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general The friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of 4 bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill This experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over 300 per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels ,0
 Looks like rooms are not cleaned properly We stayed for four nights On the first evening my son unpacked a book and threw packaging under the bed which I noticed later The teared packaging has not been picked up until we were leaving and I saw it and threw away Not a great evidence of cleaning service ,0
 Overpriced hotel Rude check in staff and customer relations Long queue for breakfast area was too small for the amount of people Bar staff put in doubles when didn t ask for them so were charged twice the price Will NEVER stay here again BVooking com need to remove this hotel from their website as it is one of the worst i have ever stayed at ,0
 Restaurant too small for a full hotel eating breakfast We weren t prepared to wait and went elsewhere Sofa bed a little uncomfortable,0
 My 4th but now final stay at the Park Plaza County Hall What has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations 4 night stay in a Studio King Family with plenty of issues 1 Studio King is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation 2 Lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor 10 15mins The lift simply prioritises higher floors every time Yes there are stairs but with a 7 month pregnant wife I shouldn t have to rely on them 3 Breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace 10 15 mins average wait for a table 4 Temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool 5 Shower Water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum 6 Concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting 15 mins I had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time 7 Lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel All in all an absolute joke yes I understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation What was my go to Central London hotel is now a NEVER AGAIN hotel ,0
 The windows didnt open as a result there wasnt enough fresh air into the room and all the smells were kept inside It was extremely hot and there was no way to regulate the air temperature i had to ask twice to switch the heat off at the reception The no of lifts was not enough for all the visitors nor was the no of emploees at the reseption desk Room service food was low quality and very expensive Our room wasnt cleaned every day and the sheets as well The sofa bed for the kids was not confortable we asked for a room in the upper floors with view but we got one in the 4th the hotel has 14 16 floors with no view at all ,0
 Beds and pillows were a little hard and the glass sliding door on the toilet offered little privacy should you need it ,0
 We had to queue for breakfast It was worth the wait but not what we expected ,0
 Most disappointed in the heating system as was unable to turn it up and as we would like to have done to complain at least until occasions we were to Cold most of the time the air conditioning unit would only blow cold and not hot ,0
 It is difficult to work the heater in the room It was a cold week ,0
 Restaurant seems to be understaffed so service was quite slow Too many new employees probably due to Christmas and they could not answer to questions and provide much help ,0
 Unfortunately we did have a slight problem with the ac the thermostat would not work from the room so I had to call front desk and they would control it To be fair they did also send an electric heater to keep the room warm ,0
 Some things were in urgent need of repair and attention such as the loose fittings on the shower unit and a corner of the bathroom false wall was breaking away ,0
 Dining room is too small for the amount of guests we had to wait longtime before we could sit down Breakfast also needs more variaton ,0
 No kettle in the room even though there were tea making facilities I borrowed one from my daughter in the room next door ,0
 That the hotel is not the one in the photos but the one across the road with a view of a wall Not 4 ,0
 We noticed that the front door of the hotel lets in a lot of cold air you can even feel it in the bar Other than that this hotel is perfect ,0
 Sadly there was no hot water as the boiler had broken but they were working to fix it and did give us a complimentry breakfast,0
 The suite was cold The heating was not working it could not be turned up in December ,0
 breakfast at 19 50 was disappointing I had room service and food was cold Vegetarian sausages were just veg fingers and not appetising first thing in the morning I suggest quorn or Cauldron sausages Tomatoes not cooked and toast very pale and cold and the Danish pastry was missing Not enough milks sugars for day ,0
 The room wasn t ready at check in when we really needed a rest We were given a free drink at the bar though which went some way to compensate ,0
 Room had not been made up when we had gone out for the day even thou we told reception we were going out for the day the bath tap shot water out from the side of the filler all over the toilet seat and up the wall the plug in the sink did not work and the shower head water came out from above the shower head it self all got fixed but not the bath filler as found this out on last night taking a bath but did report it so others staying did not have the same problem as we did ,0
 For a four star hotel the breakfast was not great and barely better than Premier Inn Watery egg mass produced sausages horrible coffee and fruit juice ,0
 We were in a studio adjacent to the atrium Whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise The bedroom is near the door right at the atrium It s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary On the second day when checking out I asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room 702 I believe so they could hear for themselves We got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken With the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable Beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out ,0
 Booked a family room No a c heating working 2 small children Moved room supposedly an Upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass Spent the night in a cold bedroom Not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs A very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office I still had to pay ,0
 Rainwater shower head sprayed and leaked over bathroom floor it was swimming in water and had to be mopped up with towel ,0
 Although it was the weekend before Christmas it was still a lot of money for the 1 night but my choice and I accept that ,0
 The bed just not very comfortable noise in the room at night from pipe work lifts and toilet extract which was off but you could still hear it running somewhere in the building,0
 Dreadful wifi connection Don t get a room on the corridor as the lifts are very noisy ask for a corner room,0
 My only downfall is that the rooms that look inside the hotel instead of outside veiw are not the good no natural sunlight cannot feel the morning,0
 Twin room but beds joined together Moved beds apart but revealed torn carpet and bare concrete Bathroom fittings loose and worn Breakfast expensive at 16 95 per person ,0
 The view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant This rendered the room windowless like a prison There was NO milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew The mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then There were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up Breakfast was overpriced I know London is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning ,0
 Attitude of staff The Spa is hurrendows with only 3 lockers unisex changing facilities and sauna steam room only enough for 2 fully grown adults ,0
 The room was cold and the A C s heating did not work Breakfast was boring and did not have anything extra only what is necessary You would expect a little more effort from a four star establishment Also breakfast was poorly coordinated and there was always a waiting before seated ,0
 Queuing for breakfast is not what I like Breakfast not ready at 8 15 shouldn t be Scrambled eggs not eatable I prefer a fresh served coffee or espresso ,0
 Breakfast could have been a little better quite busy had to queue but they coped well Pillows not quite to my taste but I am very fussy ,0
 breakfast area was too small and very cramped had to wait 20 mins to be seated No coffee or tea brought to table No cutlery on table and had to get own ordered special breakfast waited 30 mins and then after chasing we was told not available my wife had to have no breakfast when getting breakfast from area people bumping into you and you have to wait 10 minutes for eggs and ask for bacon and beans to be topped up ,0
 My stay there was fabulous and I don t have anything that I don t like ,0
 wi fi was rubbish I never got a stable connection at all Dreadful musak played constantly turn it off Room temperature centrally controlled so was constantly freezing It s possibly a London thing but I felt the service charging on every single thing such as the glass of wine i bought in the bar at 8 50 for 175ml became 9 28 even though my red was served in a white wine glass because the bar lady was cross I changed my mind to breakfast and dinner was excessive and frequently not warranted for the service received ,0
 There was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus The staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away The view from our room was not great we faced Waterloo Station but I m sure the other side of the hotel could see the London Eye The bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust ,0
 Over 50 people queuing for breakfast anticipated 30 minute wait got a refund Really not acceptable at a modern 4 star hotel Special birthday weekend spoiled ended up having breakfast in Waterloo Station ,0
 With only 3 lifts at certain times there is quite a long wait,0
 In my opinion there is no need to pay for breakfast The breakfast area is really small therefore leading to 20 40 min waits to eat We were lucky enough to be guided to a different serving area after waiting 15 min It was not worth the wait However I appreciate the kind gesture made by the staff ,0
 Very small bed Check in staff not very friendly Breakfast outrageously expensive Bar crowded and dirty ,0
 The first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for 6 years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments So as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts They are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile Im pretty sure thats what youre paid for Also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for 15mins We finally got to the station running to catch our train from London Euston time we got there we missed our train by 4mins all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain You cost me 230 to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us I was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks Hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you ,0
 The temperature of the water in the bathroom was luke warm ,0
 I was disappointed with the view all the pictures on the website seemed to show river views We were overlooking a rather busy Waterloo Station ,0
 We checked in early at 10 45 ish and was told to return after 2 pm to get our room key we left our bags and returned about 5pm after a busy day and was told they were still working in our room and it would be another 10 minutes We complained as we had to be out at 6 and they gave us another room but we thought this was really poor ,0
 I paid the Room Service bill before I actually was given the bill and there was a donation on the bill that would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted to contribute 1 00 I run a cleaning company and overall the place was very clean however was not dusty in the rooms and the mirrors were smeary The taps need descaling but this is me being picky given my profession I know how tight turnaround is There was only one T bag between three people and the room was kitted out for two people even though three were stopping so two glasses two cups two biscuits etc The cleaners were also trying to enter the room at 9 30 and out check out was 12 We inadvertently left our luggage at the wrong Plaza there was no offer to collect which was our mistake but the reception lady said we could ask but the answer would be no Make sure you get the right hotel ,0
 The sofa bed is pretty terrible and I absolutely hate the door to the bathroom It s a sliding glass door which provides very little privacy ,0
 I wasn t to please that I was expected to pay an extra 5 to watch a movie,0
 The air extractor in the Bathroom ran all night I couldn t sleep past 06 00 The shower fittings fell apart When we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared We too had an overlong wait for breakfast ,0
 N A,0
 the fact our stay was quite expensive compared to similar hotels we have stayed in in London and didn t include breakfast It would have been nice to have been checked in by a smiling receptionist making us as guests to feel welcome and special,0
 Bigger breakfast area could be an improvement but a bit of a wait and sitting very close to other tables still didn t take away from the beautiful breakfast Delicious ,0
 Optional service charge which Is added automatically on room service as well as a tray charge Double recovery not what I would expect,0
 Staff gave directions to Battersea which took us on 2 tubes and a taxi costing us approx 25 and took us an hour making us late When we went to come back we discovered it was a train directly to Waterloo costing 5 and took 15 minutes Not impressed with poor advice ,0
 Overall very happy with the Room just the Bathroom fittings were tarnished ,0
 I am not sure I got the room i booked as it seemed quite small for a superior double room As it was only a couple of nights however I dealt with it Being woken at 9am on the day of check out while the do not disturb sign was on the door too wasnt great Not usually this disappointed,0
 Inside facing room was a bit claustrophobic as could not open curtains Rubber undersheet on bed took off with difficulty Room not serviced one of the two nights Had to contact housekeeping who put it right ,0
 We had to ask for a fourth towel despite there being 4 on the booking Also had to ask for more tea bags and milk in order to make one evening drink and one in the morning ,0
 The bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that Also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out Also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room I was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all I wont be going back there anytime soon,0
 Having to que for breakfast I have never had to experience this before and won t stay here again for this reason ,0
 Understandably the hotel had over 400 rooms that needed cleaning however we were told 5 minutes and the room was much longer than 5 minutes however that being said the room was great and the view was fantastic,0
 Went to Marriott County Hall by mistake having known County Hall before it became a hotel Park Plaza County Hall is not at the old County Hall although it is nearby I think it confusing to have a Marriott County Hall and a Park Plaza County Hall close together although a traveller without prior knowledge would probably read the website more carefully than I did ,0
 Seems to be good value for money but consider you will have to queue for 20 before to get acc s to the breakfast room never experienced this before Just consider also that you will have to wait circa 7 8 every time you want take the lift Basically overcrowded for the facilities offered Management not present never ,0
 I was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about 2 3 unlikely to return on this hotel All the while i thought i could experience 5 star experience it was not I was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the 5 star hotels i been through for a 270 a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby,0
 Terrible service when the room filled with water from shower 5 people came after 3 calls not to clean but with us inside the room trying to close even beds with our clothes on them to get access to the floor tubes So 3 of us and 5 of them in a small room without even asking if they can do it just an hour before we check out Getting ready for our bussiness meeting Breakfast small with a tiny cooridords between tables Not worthy ,0
 We had flood every time we showered as shower head too strong for limited space in Bath and ill fitting screen No biscuits or hot chocolate in room and only one flannel left for two of us Also only one chair to sit on and we are two ,0
 We had an issue with sofa bed in the room we were in It was broken in the centre prior to our arrival However once we informed the staff we were accommodated in another room fairly swiftly compensated for out trouble,0
 The room was dirty dark without view even from the 8th floor The service was slow We asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later Every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour The breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish We requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option We did not receive any reply When we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another 10 pounds per hour It seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked ,0
 While it was a great idea to have guests decide whether or not to have room cleaned we would have had to give note stating this to reception by 9am I did not even read it until 10AM Why not let it be signed and left in the room or hung outside the door just a thought,0
 My only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well The sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them And we didn t get enough towels for the whole family We were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway Also extra pillows would have been nice too The kids never complained about the sofa bed ,0
 Didn t like the sofa in the lounge didn t like the little tv didn t like scaley kettle for the amount I spent expected a little bit more than a sachet of coffiee,0
 Room size is small and dated decor no privacy in the toilet as its separated via a glass door Bed size is small Queuing atleast 20 30 mins for breakfast Not good at all ,0
 The rooms are situated near kitchen which is very noisy We had to be asked to move in the middle of night because of this They did move us but the inconvenience of this was very tiring and due to this would not stay again ,0
 I paid extra for a city view but your over looking the train station and builders working,0
 The room cleaning wasn t as expected Should take care of their staff and follow up on their work ,0
 We did not stay long enough,0
 When i collected my small lovely coral coloured suitcase from the concierge before leaving it was really grubby and dented ,0
 I hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door It was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy The checking in and out process was not smooth Room was not ready when I was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready When I checked out I was given somebody else s bill I did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price I was charged ,0
 Claustrophobic common areas and mediocre breakfast If you stay here choose a room only rate and go out for all meals there s plenty of choice nearby ,0
 Staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed Never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before We waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready After a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity The delay did not help I did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel Yet the staff were a smiley as they could be Not entirely bad ,0
 Sofa bed very very uncomfortable even for the children to sleep on Requested an extra duvet to put as additional mattress to try and make a little more comfortable ,0
 You have to wait a lot of time to have breakfast it seems the area for the breakfast was too small for the capacity of the people they sleep in this hotel There was a lot of dust in the room and especially behind the TV set The bath towels seem to be very old almost becoming gray from white Too expensive,0
 Beds could have been more comfy ,0
 Sofa bed in family room was a bit lumpy and bumpy ,0
 Room was nice and contemporary the bathroom sliding glass door is not practical makes too much noise when opening and closing especially in the middle of the night when others are sleeping AND it is far from sound proof when showering and getting ready while others are still sleeping ,0
 The room was too hot despite turning the air con as low as it could go You need persistence to get room service to answer your call ,0
 The sofa bed was too squeaky and noisy the other bed was too soft and the rooms were too hot due to not being able open windows ,0
 Long queue for breakfast but it was the beginning of the Autumn holiday Breakfast room crowded ,0
 Breakfast far too pricey at 19,0
 We spent over 10 minutes waiting for an elevator the day we were checking out They definitely need more elevators ,0
 everything was perfect,0
 Breakfast Had to queue for ages 20 minutes at least to even get a table Queued right along the corridor ,0
 Breakfast let it down a bit The food was nice but the organisation of the breakfast service could be inproved ,0
 long queues for breakfast and then another queue to get fruit and toast we had to join the same queue for people wanting cooked breakfast restaurant to small for the amount of guests low water pressure on 13th floor took ages to run a bath and the plug leaked and water was not hot always normally use premier inn and wanted to make this visit special v disappointed,0
 The bathroom smelt of damp drains room 413 No signal on EE within my room and wifi kept cutting out on my iphone ,0
 Staff lack warmth all very brusque Housekeeping woke us too early with insistent banging on our door repeated 40 minutes later I printed our boarding cards at guest computer in basement keyboard needs replacement characters almost completely faded and illegible,0
 temperature control was difficult and bedding was too warm with no alternatives Restaurant was expensive and meals a bit disappointing but plenty of alternatives nearby ,0
 The room was quite cold even with AC turned up to max There was no heating as such just a cool breeze coming out of the vents that coupled with mostly tile flooring made it a chilly stay ,0
 Room view had windows that don t open as the view is within looking over the restraunts very unusual and no Fresh air,0
 Rooms were a bit small but all we needed we were hardly in them except to sleep ,0
 For the money that we paid there was no swimming pool and the beds were really uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a camping bed i found that beds in a premier inn were a lot more comfortable ,0
 Room was pokey odd sounds from water heating pipe work that sounded like a dog Room was cold we ended up switching the a c off One pillow each not two and bed wasn t as good as a Premier Inn,0
 Service at the restaurant for dinner was slow but it s only a small criticism ,0
 The room was small and hot and the a c was noisy and ineffective Little space to relax certainly not possible to enjoy a comfortable breakfast We should have booked the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge which has a better atmosphere,0
 Room size for single occupancy was just too tiny I could hardly fit in 2 bags no view atall Tv channels were vintage too with no music channel even a basic movie channel and all was paid ,0
 It took ages for us to be able to check out The staff at the checkout desk were oblivious to which customers were next in the queue due to there not being a queue system set up My husband I were waiting patiently for a long time for the 2 or 3 staff members to serve their customers when a rude man another customer went in front of us soon as a staff member was free she didn t say anything like Sorry these customers were in front of you so we had to wait another half an hour It was far too slow ,0
 The room is kimd of narrow so there is limited space to put 3 luggage in and able to fully open them ,0
 It was needed to ask for 2 hours late checkout I was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather I thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request I spent a lot of money during my stay I was just asking for 2 hours for free The staff did not call me I thought that they are accepting my request In fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours I was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just 2 hours It looked like stolen issue therefore I really would like to refund my money The supervisor did not care I confirmed to her that I will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her T shirt as a kind of the confrontation ,0
 Stayed in an accessible family room my husband and I had to sleep on the sofa bed mattress extremely thin and uncomfortable this was really disappointing and effected our impression of the hotel room overall We expected much better quality for the price charged ,0
 Immediate payment request for room service Majority of hotels accept signature on delivery receipt ,0
 I have stayed several times at Park Plaza hotels in this exact area their are three within several hundred feet This being my first time at Park Plaza Country Hall I expected the same gold standard that I have experienced at the other hotels I was staying in the Penthouse on the top floor for the weekend which means I expect Penthouse level customer service I had several issues with house cleaning security and most significant of all was the decor in the Penthouse The Penthouse has an amazing view of Big Ben Parliament and London Eye The decor is staggeringly outdated and resembles a 70 s era theme room which is not what I believe they purposely set out to do All of this really soured my experience at a hotel chain that I exclusively choose to utilize when I am in London This experience may deter me from using this specific hotel during any future trips to London That being said I reached out to Hotel Management about my experience and they showed great concern which is in the what did you like section please read ,0
 Can t think of anything we didn t like ,0
 Requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then The noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts Apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good Have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel ,0
 Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel In addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not Other than that everything was good,0
 everything was great we had a fantastic time ,0
 Reception was a not efficient I tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that I pay the first night I told her that it was better if I do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if I want to pay the rest of my stay So I thought that was really bizarre She wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing Came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good ,0
 Reservation process for family was a mess Moved to a room in front of the elevators Breakfast was always full and had a long waiting queue to get a table ,0
 The breakfast was on the expensive side for what you get ,0
 Eggs at breakfast tasted like powdered eggs and the mushrooms were tinned ,0
 The breakfast could have been priced lower It was a little on the expensive side ,0
 The bathroom shower drain produced random flapping noises through the night room 518 The bathroom was grubby around the corners of the shower and floor The air con was noisy and the room was very stuffy with it off Because we paid by debit card the room fridge was locked so any milk we brought to the room could not be kept cold Very limited clothing stowage no draws of any good size the hanging space was limited due to the ironing board spare quilts and pillows OK once they were taken out The safe was just above floor level so on your hands and knees to open it and lock it ,0
 100pounds were charged in case of extras at the moment of checking in and I do not remember having been properly informed ,0
 Temperature control in the room was not very good Just a knob with no temperature feedback Hard to get it right as there was quite a delay in the change,0
 This hotel does not have parking bay and it makes it difficult to get dropped off or take a taxi We stayed in a family studio and found a sofabed too soft The rooms at Park Plaza Westminster Bridge opposite were more spacious and more comfortable ,0
 We had to call housekeeping due to stain covered bedsheets for sofa bed which stank took half an hour before anybody came and replaced didn t help put new sheets on Kids were shattered so didn t help matters Staff seemed unhelpful was this due to Not wanting extras ,0
 room good have been a bit bigger breakfast room a bit crowded on weekends,0
 I had asked at time of booking that the room be feather free especially bedding as feathers trigger my husband s asthma This was not done and so we had to ask again at reception and then wait for someone to swap the bedding Overall staff seemed too busy ,0
 N A,0
 Bathroom had a smell which we tried to mask with perfume Also didn t like the frosted glass doors on the bathroom ,0
 Would have liked breakfast to be included in our room price or at least be a little cheaper ,0
 No fresh air No ability to open any kind of window It was very warm on our stay and it felt claustrophobic I appreciate we were on a high floor but maybe a smaller window that would allow some fresh air in would have been good ,0
 The cooked breakfast wasn t as good as I expected the eggs didn t taste like eggs and the mushrooms should always be fresh and not tinned The toast machine wasn t working either ,0
 As above but rest OK Room small but it is in Central London,0
 I never get a respond to my email asking for early check in which they didn t accept at the hotel which ruined my first day in London after such a long flight the WIFI is very bad you barely can browse or send text messages ,0
 Elevators were kind of small and slow and for some reason many people were riding them up and back down again for no apparent reason they are glass but the view is only the inside atrium making them crowded ,0
 Small room the desk chair did not pull out all the way from under the desk Mattress needed to be replaced I m used to having a flat sheet in between me and the comforter No wash cloths in bathroom ,0
 Bathroom let the suite down as it didn t look up to standard compared to the rest of the suite taps and shower looked as if it needed cleaning with a goodlime scale remover ,0
 The bathroom had a seperate door for shower which was not able to close completely and before we realized the entire room was flooded ,0
 I prefer to include breakfast in the hotel rate I paid to be more competitive with other hotels in the same class ,0
 The rooms were never made up until later afternoon despite us taking off any private signs on the door It was just too late to clean the room And the breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel We had to wait way too long to get a table ,0
 We asked the reception to please pick up the laundry we left in our room and placed inside the bag in the morning before we left the hotel However when we got back later in the evening it was not picked up ,0
 Didn t get into room until 3pm and that was only because of me complaining dirty sheets no toilet roll asked for more when came back just thrown in bathroom this is just half of it,0
 For the cost the rooms are small compared to North America But bigger here than what you will find at hotels elsewhere Staff were exceptional ,0
 Drinks a little expensive but that s London Bar staff lovely though ,0
 Breakfast room was quite small and and was some waiting for a table but if gone earlier probably wouldn t have been a problem ,0
 our door keys did not work after the first attempt the technician had to come and change the battery which delayed our trip out for nearly half an hour ,0
 We were put in a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the train station just near the cleaning room which we heard a slamming door all night We changed room with an upgrade which was still at the back of the hotel and same room Our friend checked in the same night and asked for an upgrade at check in and she got the best view ,0
 We shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed That was fine Unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door My wife and I slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light I thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed Seemed like a bad layout plan The pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it ,0
 Offering a discount 10 if booking in restaurant then finding out on bill it s only on food and you add 12 5 service charge without asking I always tip myself and hate automatic service charging Breakfast a little chaotic but good value ,0
 N a,0
 Parts of the breakfast buffet were low quality one room had no natural light which I would expect for a room labeled superior Rooms very small ,0
 Paying 167 for 1 night for an extra city view room Which is a view of the Hotel across the road Squashed breakfast tinned food Not enough seats outside to tables Faulty equipment Room not cleaned properly not actually in county hall doors not fitted properly and no milk for a hot drink completely spoilt our 30th wedding anniversary And still no contact apology from anyone at park plaza Appalling standards for an hotel which won an award ,0
 no cooking stove ,0
 At check in they hadn t realised 2 adults and 2 kids so didn t have sofa bed ready couldn t understand as email clearly stated number of guests Breakfast very busy but manageable ,0
 The view over Waterloo Station It is appreciated that this is unavoidable for a number of rooms but actually I might have paid a little more for a room with a better view ,0
 Breakfast was disappointing,0
 We had a family of 4 with sofa bed and that s the worse bed I have ever slept on There is a huge gap in the thin mattress and I somehow got through the night by putting some towels to fill it up The checkin took a very long time and the room was not ready by the time Since they couldn t predict the time we decided to walk out for site seeing although we were tired after a long flight ,0
 The breakfast was not good Taking a run of the mill buffet breakfast and turning in to something special is not complicated and creates a memorable moment that the hotel could be famous for At the moment processed scrabbled eggs cardboard bacon and over baked rolls are not the way forward Unfortunately the pineapple juice had turned and was undrinakable having said all of that the staff were nice ,0
 Breakfast was chaotic queues very long waited over half an hour one of the days were we there restaurant area is cramped and people are seated too close to each other so no privacy for a conversation No where to sit in the reception area Not exactly wheelchair accessible Photos are deceptive as the hotel isn t as close to the London Eye as the photos make out ,0
 poor breakfast extra charge for the omelet which is unacceptable Big queues very day after 8 30 for breakfast because the restaurant was extra small and you had to wait long for taking the lifts,0
 The staff were all friendly However I was shoked the room was so dusty everywhere even the tables and i have kids with me I think they should take care about the cleaning part because it is the most important thing The key card for the room was not working well everytime we had to get in and we had to call the reception for fixing it Also most important channels in the TV Were not working and there is no looby as far as I noticed Also we had a late check in at 3 30pm on the arrival date ,0
 Our view was just another hotel across the street Careful when booking the photos seem to give the impression it is the hotel at the end of Westminster bridge but that another from the same company Can sometimes be a 5 10 minute wait for breakfast table as dining area is too small for such a large hotel ,0
 The second bed in the suite room was very uncomfortable We had to wait for breakfast every day because the hotel was crowed and the dining room was not big enough,0
 Bar prices were a bit costly but had to take this in to consideration as we were in the center of London,0
 The bed was too soft for us and nappy changing area not sign posted in the last cubicle in the female WC down stairs also should be in an area where dad can do nappy changes ,0
 Room smelled of drains Sofa bed not made up Insufficient number towels toiletries for a family of three No tea coffee etc available in room Breakfast long queue hot food cold No eggs Could not have breakfast in mezzanine designated area insufficient capacity to accomodate volume of guests so served in a conference room not prepared ,0
 I chose the hotel as it stated that it has an indoor pool the spa was good but I was expecting a pool ,0
 The rooms advertised as having city views were a little misleading as to view any of the city you had to press your head up against the window to look between the 2 buildings opposite although you could then See Big Ben,0
 Not a clean hotel or clean room wardrobes and cupboards covered in marks and stains glass in lifts covered in smears dust and stains as were the glass balustrades within the hotel rooms aren t soundproof as room next door had a baby in room which we could hear crying bar and restaurant food not worth the money ,0
 Breakfast main lounge was overcrowded at 9 00am so had to use upstairs dining area Then there was a mix up over our pre booked breakfast which had to be sorted However after that all fine ,0
 More toiletries,0
 We were very happy and have no complaints,0
 Sofa bed had a metal bar that was very uncomfortable The shower only had hot water no matter how many attempts we made No pool ,0
 I think just a personal thing but I did not like the rooms as they did not have a window to the outside just the interior and thus they were dark The room itself was nicely laid out and the bed was very comfortable ,0
 The breakfast wasn t warm enough Tasteless mushrooms and scrambled eggs could be better ,0
 I was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly More specifically Brad Brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right Without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization He claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than 7 nights I told him I was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written He said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies I told him I disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments I asked to speak to his manager he said I am the manager Then I asked to speak to his superior Then he said I will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount I told him this will not work as it will take at least 5 days to reverse the payment He said that he is sure it will take few hours Unfortunately he cancelled it and took 5 working days During this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted Of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank I was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me Horrible customer experience ,0
 Had to move room due to an infestation of ants On arriving home and checking the bank we were overcharged by 50 for our stay Hotel also said we used the mini bar when we didnt Not happy ,0
 Free Wifi only 1MBit but upgrade to 5MBit just 7GBP per day why so complicated No balcony,0
 The open area with the glass just waist high was scary with young kids,0
 overall for the cost of the stay I thought the food could have been better only had breakfast and it was not great cleanliness could have been better Location not great ,0
 Stepping out of the bath almost required a ladder ,0
 Mold around the bath Inwards window so people from the lifts and on the otherside of the walkway could see straight in your room and there was no daylight in the room No mirror in bedroom,0
 Waited past 2 for our room key and little extras tokens for the kids were not received until alot later after I enquired about them this was of course after we had our evening meal small problems no major ones on the whole a pleasurable experience ,0
 Long wait for a lift,0
 Room over an hour late and staff not my problem attitude,0
 Great location Dinner in the restaurant was delicious Housekeeping staff were amazing did a really thorough job Breakfast waiting staff very attentive in difficult and sometimes chaotic working conditions Great views from the room,0
 It would have been great if there was a pool or even the option to use the pool in the park plaza just across the road I was disappointed that they no longer have an executive suite it is still mentioned on the website so I had kind of expected it with the room we booked The beds could have been more comfortable but maybe they are just a bit old ,0
 bit expensive for food and drink were told we were upgraded but the room was as last visit kids were at the rear view not at the front,0
 Restaurant staff seemed more interested in talking to each other than serving guests then a little snappy when we asked another server for help,0
 The view was a big disappointment Paid a lot of money for a suite and double room to have a fantastic view for one night it was a very ho hum view over industry and train station yard Bathrooms were just ok with sliding door and smallish ,0
 The room was overpriced The bathroom was cramped The place lacks decor and warmth Lifts too slow and crowded Overall not a great stay ,0
 The room is starting to look slightly tired Reception was noisy and not particularly attractive Didn t bother visiting restaurant because of this ,0
 very noisey place and we were woken up each morning early by the cleaners we did not sleep very well in the two nights we stayed ,0
 no smell in the first place and a warmer room but as stated both were resolved quickly,0
 Queue at breakfast time a bit annoying needs a bigger restaurant room for 4 people is very small and cramped but guess one has to live with that ,0
 Don t have breakfast in the overflow room Food tasted like it had been cooked for hours and wasn t hot ,0
 The shower was terrible difficult to operate and just a teickle of water Hard to get into due to the height of the bath ,0
 Bed not particularly comfortable had a topper and extra under sheet neither of which fitted and stayed put during the night ,0
 The quilt in our room was a bit too thick which made us sweating even we had turned down the room temperature to very low ,0
 Not mad on an internal facing room I like natural light and it felt a little claustrophobic but that s me ,0
 There was obviously a drainage problem in the bathroom so the room smelled terrible I wished I d complained earlier as when I did complain it was too late for the hotel to do anything about it and they didn t seem too bothered about it either The hotel is pretty tired and the staff weren t very friendly either not the best experience we have had ,0
 Not enough dining space for breakfast Limited fried eggs one per person Room on second floor overlooking another hotel room in the front despite of paying premium price ,0
 No window for natural light room was internal and the air con was very cold even when altered or the room became very hot without ,0
 Breakfast is over priced for what it is worth and flow of busy times are not managed well due to lack of staff At least a complimentary bottle of water should be offered with room for the price of one night ,0
 very unhelpful and unfriendly and unflexible managment we wanted to change the room we booked in the beginning because no one mentioned the room we booked does not fit the guest amount however they were complicating it ,0
 Bar Breakfast we had to wait 40mn in the queue Cool system flowing on the ground Family room too small TV couldn t be seen totally from the bed I will never recommend,0
 Chaotic concierge could not handle the volume of luggage arriving Overcrowded breakfast room breakfast was an uncomfortable experience Insufficient lift capacity long queues for lifts at times,0
 The restaurant of breakfast was too small for huge hotel We should to wait about 15 20 min to set in a table The value of money was over to this hotel ,0
 The TV was a bit small and the sofa bed was really hard But our son didn t seem to mind ,0
 Restaurant too small to cope with numbers at breakfast Hotel advertises rooms with views of London but our room faced inwards ie no view ,0
 The beds and pillows are not comfortable and under the sofa bed was not cleaned plastic bags and crackers and the shower box not cleaned well and a bit broken ,0
 Just some information about how to use the transport taxi buses underground and parking and also remind to pay the congestion charge,0
 Needed a curtain between bedroom and sitting areas budget toilet roll ,0
 The sausages were a little bit pale looking for my liking and the restaurant got very busy at breakfast with several people queuing but luckily we got down early enough to avoid the wait ,0
 The restuarant was good However they did not have non dairy milk to cater for those with lactose intolerance or vegans Would have loved to have either soya or almond milk ,0
 Very busy hotel Breakfast room crowded and noisy Inconsistent housekeeping in terms of towels left etc but this was remedied immediately ,0
 I guess maybe a fan in the room Ac works great im just not used to the humidity ,0
 The bedroom soundproffing was really poor as we could hear the client of the next room snoring at night ,0
 Check in could be quicker We were lost and ended up at the wrong Park Plaza hotel and queued for check in and were then redirected and queued again ,0
 The bathroom could have been a little bit more private a almost see through glass door is not appropriate for everyone and it s not sound isolated either ,0
 Didn t like the restaurant as tables were too close together And the pillows on the bed were very soft ,0
 No extra pillows available on request King size bed was a small King Air conditioning was not working properly on a hot day and no windows to open ,0
 One lift was out of action for the whole of our stay quite long waits ,0
 The lady cleaning the spa could ve been abit less snappy moany but apart from that it was all good ,0
 Extra bed very uncomfortable The mattress was far too thin Air conditioning completely inadequate ,0
 Dining area was very cramped during peak breakfast time with little room to move between tables when going to the buffet area ,0
 The fold out couch had dirty used tissues in it and it was extremely uncomfortable The double bed was also very uncomfortable Overall just not worth the money ,0
 The bedroom was comfortable but didn t like the window overlooking the atrium Bathroom was a wet room which flooded all the floor when the shower was used not ideal Fittings in bathroom tired old and some broken towels old and grey Only stayed 2 nights would not have liked to have stayed longer Expected better from the rate which is charged ,0
 The breakfast area and food was very poor for a four star hotel it was all selfserving so the cooked breakfast was luke warm where u eat had s caffeine feel about it this is very poor for the money,0
 Requested high room with view Affirmed that this could happen but asked to wait half hour while room prepared Two hours later and repeated visits to reception to check room was finally available No view When querying this was told that no twin rooms had views of London Eye Should have been told this in first place and would have not had yo wait for room Diasspointing sevice Beware ,0
 Being ripped off because of the conference that was being held there Not paid for by corporate but charged same inflated price isn t fair in ordinary holiday or leisure customers,0
 Unprofessionalism untrained staff getting authorisation from my guests s cards without prior notice drinks served in dirty glasses in the restaurant ,0
 The room did not smell nice The view from the room was the worst we ve ever had ,0
 The drain in the bathroom had an unpleasant smell,0
 Everything was great at the hotel until breakfast which was a shambles long line of people waiting to be seated tried to push 3 of us on a very small table for 2 and did not like it when we refused to be seated until they found a table for 3 people ,0
 Concierge is very week They said they made a booking for airport taxi for me by the time arrived they said no taxi ,0
 Couple of negatives no HD on TV And breakfast area was busy and a bit open for my taste ,0
 Despite being a superior twin room the room was so small that the beds were pushed together like a double bed The hallway was being decorated on our floor which meant decorating sheets and paint smells although they did seem to finish in just one day ,0
 The house keeping can be improved The staff forgot to replenish the tea and coffe amenities frequently ,0
 Can t think of anything ,0
 The breakfast is exactly the same each day which can get a little boring A lil variety would go a long way,0
 Dust in TV table that accompanied us througout our stay Not renewing some amenities daily Room service is expensive given the quality and quantity of the food ,0
 Breakfast slightly pricy but not overly so ,0
 The price It is expensive but you definatley get what you pay for here Its perfect,0
 Drinks in the hotel bar were far too expensive bought 2 basic drinks at over 16 00 meant that no more drinks in what was such a beautiful hotel bar No VFM,0
 The room was ridiculously small Impossible to pull chair out from the desk as the bed was so close Not a choice for business travellers,0
 Shower over bath with only half glass screen floor was very wet after each shower Lost Internet during power cut ,0
 Being woken at 5am by a wake up call I did not order Being woken ten minutes later by a phone call Then the teenagers next door slammed the door numerous times from 6am to 6 45am until I asked them to stop The manager on duty was not helpful and advised that I was not the only one woken up by the automated wake up call system He advised that at least 15 other guests were also called that did not make me feel better and there was no effort to mitigate my dissatisfaction ,0
 bathroom smelled like a sewer rooms were very small and cramped pull out couch in the suite was very uncomfortable breakfast buffet was chaotic and poor quality,0
 Pricey but I suppose it is London One small point used the bath and although there was no visible dirt in it when I got in it was obvious that it hadn t been cleaned since the last person had used it ,0
 Hotel too old definitely need a renovation Smelly drainage problem and rusty toilet utilities Dark room smaller than what the photos shown noisy refrigerators Changed the room twice and waste a lot of my time without any compensation not even a late check out for free The staff is helpful but seems they are adapted to the complains I doubt these problems are usual ,0
 A little on the expensive side but you get what you pay for and hey that s London ,0
 One of the 2 TV s in the room was not working would have been nice if it was other than all was great ,0
 Although we had an upgrade the bed was situated by the entry door and the view over looked Waterloo station with the Shard way in the distance Having stayed at Park Plaza before the scenic view wasn t as good as what we ve experienced in the past i e the London Eye Despite this we still had a pleasant stay and I would recommend the Park Plaza County Hall ,0
 Bed was a bit on the soft side ,0
 Customer Service was very poor no bedding for my children had to wait at 10pm for housekeeping to come and make the bed after e mailing to ask for a fan and told one would be in room we had to make about 6 phone calls to het one no managers on to discuss situation sunday and now it appears they have overcharged me,0
 The sofa bed for the children was really uncomfortable I ended up sleeping on it with one of the children as they wouldn t settle ,0
 Up on check out i was inform that they didn t charge anything to my credit card I was asked to pay by Cash I paid my bill including room charge by cash over 1674 pounds They have Charged 1000 upon arrival to my credit card and another 2660 on Checkout I have inform my bank and waiting for the answer I will file this to court This was really disappointing ,0
 We had to pay full price for breakfast even though my wife just had 2 rounds of toast and a pot of tea ,0
 Would have liked a more varied menu for our evening meal All Italian ,0
 Breakfast was too expensive Need some eat and run options as our tours left early each morning or even a sack lunch we could purchase ,0
 I found the bathroom a little clinical reminded me of a stay in hospital Room Service food could be better ,0
 I would have been annoyed with the view given had I had to pay full price as looking into the atrium was fine for the cost and duration of my stay any longer at full price I would have not been happy ,0
 Internet speed of 1MB apparently I didn t test it as my data plan runs faster But there was no milk supplied for my tea a true travesty ,0
 We didn t have cold water coming out of the taps in our room due to mixer taps passing wasn t worth complaining about as we only was there another day so just bought a couple of bottles of water to drink and brush our teeth with,0
 Minor detail that I am a vegetarian and found the scrambled eggs too creamy It would be nice to have more egg than cream The hot chocolate was not proper hot chocolate either but again a minor observation ,0
 The prices are high but really this is too be expected within this area of London ,0
 issues with Media and TV Wifi could be better and for the price should be free for the best connection ,0
 we had a meal for 4 people in the Italian restaurant sadly the meal wasn t to a very good standard my main course was not cooked properly I did complain to be told that red bloody chicken was a normal way to serve baby chicken a lot of money for a meal that left 2 men still hungry over priced a complete let down ,0
 We arrived at 11 30 and it would of been nice to freshen up from our long journey but we could not get in the room until after 2pm ,0
 Parking next door too small tight,0
 If I was being very picky then the only thing is i would have preferred a soft close toilet seat only because I have one and out of habit I kept letting the seat slam down ,0
 Had to pay for items in the fridge shouldn t have to when your paying so much ,0
 We had a kitchenette Some more bench space would have been nice The microwave took all the bench ,0
 we were charged for something we did not consume but after several emails with their staff it was reversed so all good ,0
 Stiff and short bed sttiff sofa long dark hair in our bed sloppy scrambled egg dirty cutlery bottled bleached tap water warm friut juice with a glass no bigger than a thumb,0
 Called to request early check in and was advised I needed to book an additional night night before to guarantee This was ridiculous as I only wanted to check in an hour or so earlier than the 3pm time stated I declined this and turned up at 2 40pm and was told the room wont be ready until 3 I felt this was unreasonable as I offered to pay for early check in as it was my sons birthday which is why we was staying at the hotel We wont be staying again ,0
 It took a while in the lifts to get to and from room bar area was a little small considering hotel was child friendly Childs menu was not much choice the breakfast was very poor coffee tasted like the cheapest coffee you could buy not much room in breakfast restaurant or in the bar definitely not worth the money we paid,0
 I paid in advance on arrival and was disappointed that I was not advised that I could not charge our meal to the room Would have been better if I had been asked if I wanted the facility to charge to the room although not a major problem The message light on the phone continued flashing all night although there were no messages We couldn t get it to turn off so just moved the phone so it wasn t annoying ,0
 Couldn t turn off the rather noisy air con in the living room Terrace could do with some outdoor seating and a table Disliked the sliding glass door to the bathroom ,0
 sofa bed was uncomfortable according to the person who slept in it mattress was too thin and frame could be felt through the mattress ,0
 my room was a bit hot and I couldn t regulate it but my daughters was fine ,0
 View from room overlooking bins and graffiti Room service didn t understand our request and we finished up with 4 plates so shortcake and paid nearly 16 for the privilege ,0
 The room was very warm due to the design and not being able to open windows Air con too noisy to have on all night to cool it down,0
 duvet had holes in it and it was all stained curtains were dirty cleaner didn t speak English so got confused when I asked her to clean the room the extra bed was very uncomfortable ,0
 Bed needs changing You ll still have a good night sleep on it but I would suggest changing it soon Otherwise you cant complain really ,0
 12 5 service charge added to everything including drinks in the bar Our room had a small kitchen area with sink towel and washing up liquid provided so a cloth would have been a good idea ,0
 The parking in the area was poor and the food was a bit on the pricey side ,0
 Room service wasn t cheap and the tray charge and service charge hike the bill But it is clearly stated in the menu ,0
 The aircon was terrible and there was no key to open the door Room was so hot and stuffy which effected our sleep ,0
 The TV were a bit small I think movies should be free and the Internet should free as well even more than 100mg Other than that everything was great Thank you Mr Daniel for the best hospitality ,0
 We arrived at 6 30pm but room wasn t ready Was given complimentary drinks while we waited We waited for 45 minutes Kitchenette tap and sink tap in the bathroom leaked The sofa bed was old and uncomfortable to sleep on and water could be heard coming down the pipes behind the bathroom throughout the night The wifi was very slow ,0
 Reception staff poor on arrival it was 11 at night and I just wanted sorted and into bed they wanted me to pay 25 up front for minibar and bar Reception on check out first clasd,0
 Supposed upgrade to a studio when we had booked a twin Bed settee was very very uncomfortable Breakfast was reasonable Location was good Staff were friendly ,0
 1 price it s expensive about the room size and facilities sofa bed it s brok TV Chanel it s pooring and few if you want see move through Tv you must paid for that price ,0
 Check in was a little chaotic but provision of cold drinks was a welcoming touch When check in time is 2 o clock you expect your accomodation to be ready at two However a complimentary drink at the bar was readily given by the apologetic reception staff ,0
 One lift was out of order not a massive problem but it did take some time to travel up to floor 13,0
 Name suggests the hotel is part of the old County Hall GLC building which it is not but it is a 2 minute walk away and dont let that put you off ,0
 At 11 at night are bathroom ended up flooded because of a drain issue Somehow the cleaning staff managed to overlook a plastic cup clogging the drain My belief is then that there s no way they cleaned the shower before we arrived Absolutely disgusting ,0
 The beds weren t very comfy and the pillows were practically non existent ,0
 The Bathroom Door jammed but no one s fault really ,0
 Too expensive room at times too hot no pool or sitting room to read kitchenette fridge too small and no toaster sofa uncomfortable,0
 the size of the room too small bedding too hot no top sheet so couldn t throw the quilt back although there was a room temperature control but this was a bit noisy ,0
 Room wasn t that clean cup marks on tables everything a little worn some grime in bathroom Hotel felt rather crowded especially the reception area Lifts were slow,0
 Woken in early hours by wailing of the plumbing from room above next door Horrible noise and ruined my attempt to catch up on a precious bit of sleep Gave feedback on checkout they promised to investigate and fix but that doesn t help me much ,0
 A bit more information about complimentary upgrade We did not really need a studio and would simply have preferred a largish comfortable room,0
 Big sliding glass door on bathroom was noisy and kept popping out of it s runner Small complaint really didn t alter enjoyment of stay ,0
 Had a change of plans and couldn t cancel an unwanted night but think that was because the booking was made through booking com,0
 Old air conditioning doesn t work I put that on the coldest and still didn t worked Bathroom water system very old it made a bad noise when we were there No place to drop off and pick up ,0
 The shower hot water didn t get warmer than tepid had to boil a few kettles of warm to make a warm bath ,0
 The aircon wasn t working in our room on the hottest day of the year We called twice for it to be sorted and no one came or bothered to call I complained at check out and the staff didn t seem bothered Not impressed at all ,0
 Regular attempts by staff to enter my room Also breakfast venue was full of young children creating a chaotic environment ,0
 The TV should be relocated away from the desk as it s uncomfortable watching from a less than a metre away And get a bigger screen ,0
 My room was given to other guests when they checked in I was out but my clothes etc where clear to be seen When I spoke to the reception the response was I am night staff so I don t know anything This was a surprisingly unhelpful and unsatisfactory response I also had to phone 4 times for someone to open my safe before the v pleasant gentleman arrived ,0
 Room not as described on hotel website Poor service from staff Plastic rubber sheets over mattress made the bed uncomfortable House keeping staff knocking on the door early in the morning on a bank holiday ,0
 Couldn t open my balcony door Bed was far to soft and uncomfortable Mattress needs replacing Breakfast was plentiful but the ingredients were cheap This impacted on the taste which was not good at all Eggs tasted powered sausages tasted like they had been cooked the day before Bacon had absolutely no flavour Cereals tasted old and we re obviously the cheaper brands Orange juice was out of a long life carton I m sure It s a shame the hotel obviously try s to save money on the breakfast as this is a guests last memory of the property and it s not good I was not the only guest unhappy with it judging by the guarded whispers heard at the breakfast table ,0
 Room was small and not very clean The bathroom door had stains on it Room was very cold and it took a while to get it to normal temperature The shower handle was leaking ,0
 the cost for breakfast on a per person basis was a good 100 above availability nearby ,0
 The wifi was working but it could have been a bit faster But it wasn t a big issue ,0
 No cold fridge had to use mini bar and ice from ice machine Had a pizza in the restaurant not very nice,0
 came back after running marathon No room to sit in very small downstairs bar unable to get snack and drink Should have opened upstairs restaurant to accommodate everyone Eve before no proper menu in restaurant just a buffet which did not look very good ,0
 Bigger kitchenette and fridge Bedroom which could be closed off ,0
 We ate in the Italian restaurant on Friday evening Our waitress was exceptional but this was were our experience ended The food was truly atrocious My husbands spaghetti bolognese went back twice but was still luke warm My steak was below average and how a kitchen can not cook chips so that they are not rock hard is beyond belief Such a shame ,0
 Just the cost of drinking in the hotel bar is the major downfall of this and to be fair most hotels ,0
 room had no milk for coffee n hot chocolate sachets had no dressing gowns n complementary water,0
 Expected a bigger room for the price Room had arrangements for tea and coffee but no cups mugs No dentalkit vanity kit in the rooms These are basic things expected in a room especially for the price paid and considering it is a 4 star hotel ,0
 Bed was uncomfortable No robe and slippers Room service drinks were expensive and served in the most tiny glasses Water should be in the room on arrival Some biscuits with the tea facilities would be a nice touch Toast was cold Pizza was substandard Shower can be scorching no need to have a gauge that can raise the temperature to such a dangerous level,0
 Bed is not comfortable as well as the sofa bed Low quality pillows Small electronic fredge mini bar auto charge on moving stuff ,0
 I prefer wooden floors and windows that open so hard to find in the UK The light inside the closet wouldn t go off no matter how firmly I closed it which was annoying as it was right beside the bed ,0
 I had a room to the inner side w o a real window The price is rather high ,0
 I had requested for early check in inspire of positve email earlier the check in staff declined me early check in This was very disappointing Also being a Club Carlson member did notbenefit me in getting an upgrade or better response ,0
 The sofa bed,0
 The bathroom had a smell of drains the whole time we were there If we left the bathroom door open then the whole room stank Informed reception who were very apologetic Also we arrived at the restaurant at 9pm and were told we couldn t use it as they had a booking of 15 people due It didn t look too busy as there were plenty of empty tables but we were told we had to use the bar instead so we went elsewhere ,0
 Very limited in room Tea and refreshments no bottled water etc a bigger fridge would be helpful for families Sofa bed mattress was very hard but slept ok though ,0
 Really could not fault the place,0
 Hotel needs more than location to be good Hire better staff Worst hotel ever I had booked penthouse suite for 1 night I would never ever use park plaza brand anywhere in the world Park plaza county hall should be a case study on how to lose customers Check in Early check in request was met with callous attitude the front desk seemed to enjoy the ordeal seeing us in distress of red eye from Washington with an ill family member All the front desk members were doings were enjoying my frustration Asked me to come back at 2PM as the policy stated I walked in exactly at 2PM guess what room wasn t ready Excuses and stories followed I didn t expect early check as a right but 2 problems 1 attitude of staff 2 weren t ready with room even as per written policy They played usual practice of offering me free breakfast which I refused and did not use Room Poor and dated furnishing Cheap furniture wardrobe doors did not close Air condition thermostat buttons don t work for setting the desired temperature you have to call the desk and tell them and they set it from maintenance room somewhere Room was freezing again at night causing my family members sickness grow bad and no one could sleep Silver lining Checkout was smooth with nice staff manager intervened during check in and tried to damage control sounded more constrictive and sensitive Hotel needs to hire such people everywhere ,0
 Poor bathroom shower leaked all over the place and poor control of water flow No where to hang towels or bathrobes One bedside light didn t work What is it about hotels in this category where there s no mirror above the dressing table ,0
 Breakfast not included and u have to pay 16 per adult but they were clear from the bigining and mentioned that on booking ,0
 Breakfast was 18 00 each which is very overpriced and even more so for small children Not too sure where the decking area was where you can have a drink which is displayed in the pictures overlooking the London eye which is misleading ,0
 The pull out sofa bed was a little uncomfortable as the mattress wasn t very thick Fairly understandable I suppose ,0
 Stayed twice now and both times been charged for things we have not used We also had to change rooms as first room did not smell to good ,0
 Room not cleaned next day had to request this Bathroom smelled of rotten eggs the whole stay Overcharged on mini bar bill Had to prove we were staying there to concierge on 2nd night to get into our room ,0
 Unfortunately we experienced a couple of problems with the restaurant and bar food which we considered to be of less than excellent quality and not sufficiently hot when served ,0
 Not worth the money expensive and they even said they cant give us an HDMI cable so we could connect our laptop with the TV And the front desk guy was even rude when we asked I was very disappointed The rooms are smaller then they look on the pictures ,0
 bar area a bit like a wimpy bar Also the restaurant area was more like a canteen However the food was far below even a canteen standard Wouldn t touch the cooked breakfast on offer Made do with fruit toast and coffee ,0
 There was a party one evening and the music was very loud until around 2 am I round suggest that families should be higher up in th hotel if there are functions planned ,0
 Breakfast could have been warmer Cooked food tasty but a little cold Coffee really hot and good ,0
 Couldn t fault anything Our stay was perfect ,0
 Attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in Studio was smaller that I expected It came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee Also fridge space could just about accommodate a 2 litre milk bottle Not enough toiletries provided for a family of four Two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time There seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets Had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the Friday and Saturday night Not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids Steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly Lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny Also black algae in our shower surround Had to repeatedly get key card reactivated Room was showing signs of wear and tear Faucet tap was loose Mirror was cracked Worst of all was the stench from the drains This was stifling some times usually at night ,0
 I am pretty sure when I booked it was suggested that breakfast was included but this wasn t the case Parking information on area wasn t great Although we did find a great deal after some searching other sites online ,0
 Have stayed in a Junior Suite for several nights Very bad house keeping not even a 2 star level leaving areas unclean never changing the bed sheets unless you told them They failed most of the nights to fill up nespresso capsules One night the whole floor was lost power it was returned back after half an hour without any apologies Buffet breakfast was below average 20 per person The waiter asked for extra 4 for an omelet ,0
 Well it s London so parking is a drag ,0
 Just that it would have been better if she didnt have to walk across the walkway as she has a height phobia but you didn t know this ,0
 Breakfast was very busy at peak times too much queuing for our liking but the food was good quality ,0
 Both of the taps were warm so I couldn t get any cold water The dish towel was not very good and did not dry the dishes well,0
 A small thing it was difficult to get a fresh fried egg at breakfast time The egg fryer was not very cooperative and often unavailable They charge extra for an omelette ,0
 I stayed in room 621 at checkout reception didn t ask if I had a good stay and I forgot to mention my complaint as I was in a hurry heading off for a meeting room 621 has an adjoining door the noise from the next room into mine was ridiculous the door may as well have been left open I enjoyed multiple different people staying in the room next to me think 622 over course of my stay and was continually awoken at times ranging from midnight to 2 30am in the morning I don t think they realised how think the space was between the adjoining doors this would put me off staying again at this hotel,0
 Queue at check in and flimsy frosted glass door on bathroom not sufficiently private for twin room,0
 Better towels and more milk and sugar available in the room,0
 Room for 3 people but serviced and adequate for 2 people only 1 double bed and 1 sofa instead of 3 separated bed ,0
 Unfort we had a dreadful experience in the Hotels Italian eatery after waiting an hour got food the staff came to explain they had lost the order could we start again we were famished to start with the complimentary breadsticks did not really lift our dissapointment,0
 Not a clean room bathroom floor tiles are broken and it s leaking in the shower cabin Towels are not very clean it s not a white colour very old ,0
 The dining room was a little cold at the door end That didn t affect us as we were seated right by the servery but could have been uncomfortable for those at that end ,0
 Doesn t have own car parking but there are places nearby ,0
 When I arrived there was a red blood looking stain on the bed cover and hairs near the toilet in the bathroom Drinks were very expensive and room maids entered our room in the morning 4 5 times despite us telling them we did not require room maids which i m really not happy about We also started a tab in the bar which we agreed to pay upon checkout on our final day we then had a phone call at 1am whilst we were sleeping to tell us that the bill had to be paid instantly before they shut their tills It s such a shame because the location is excellent ,0
 Upgraded to an executive room price was a little high for what you get was told it was a quite room but you could still here guest above us Breakfast was okay but could of been better ,0
 I would say that our bathroom could do with being updated as it was noticeably rusty Otherwise it was a great stay ,0
 Personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at 2 45 this morning when I happened to wake Just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room Fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay I would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room I don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was 18 each we opted to take a 5 minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for 5 each,0
 A little confusion over the room I booked a superior double and was told that the room was a studio room This just put the booking in doubt Also when we arrived in the room there were balloons and a bottle of wine with a card it was my partners birthday but the card had a different name on not my partner after I queried this the goodies were collected but it left us feeling that we were given the wrong room ,0
 Restaurant has no spaghetti no garlic bread etc etc we were in a group of 12 and there was several dishes unavailable the desert was tiny wouldn t use the restaurant again,0
 The breakfast was not good value for money,0
 The pictures from online made it seem the room was bigger than actually was Bathroom door I didn t like ,0
 Restaurant quiet small very busy even at supposedly quiet times for breakfast We had to queue and wait for table as three of us Staff tried hard to seat people ASAP City view was a view of the railway station Not the view I expected,0
 Very small breakfast room causing massive slow queues for breakfast Long wait for lifts and house cleaning was poor when they turned up ,0
 Every morning you have to stand in a line to get to the restourant for 20 40 minutes just to get your breakfast The windows are not opening in the room so there is no fresh air Have problems with the safe box do not work and with the door to the room cant open need to call engenier ,0
 Rainforest shower head dirty required cleaning before use alarm clock radio set to BST stay early January no instructions on how to reprogram,0
 The drench shower didn t work properly as holes blocked by lime scale so more of a drizzle However also had a normal shower attachment which worked fine ,0
 Perhaps some recliners and relaxing chilling area in spa but this is in mo way a complaint,0
 The only thing was the washbasin tap that looked a little tired ,0
 The staff were poor on discovering a hair in my room service meal Refused a refund of the whole meal Just generally set up a bad scene for the remainder of the break away Wanted to refund me the one meal I said the rest was ruined They came and collected all the food including the absolutely fine desserts before actioning a refund Terribly backward way of customer service ,0
 Some language barrier with a member of staff as he didn t understand but overcome with help from his colleague,0
 Only that the hairdryer didn t work and I had to wait quite a while for someone to bring me another one so my hair was nearly dry and not sitting right ,0
 There was a strange howling noise that disturbed my sleep in the morning I think it was the wind through the vents the breakfast was good but a little over priced,0
 No complaints,0
 AC and Warm air needs to function better and be more user friendly ,0
 honestly My wife and I were really looking for a room with a view on London Eye and or the Big Ben Plus we did not like the bathroom door style a bit transparent and openable from outside our little son has no boundaries ,0
 The Shower wasn t very hot and the windows didn t open at all which for one night was manageable but for a longer stay would have been a problem as we like fresh air ,0
 Wifi signal Television could be positioned in a better location,0
 Honestly the only thing I would say is not great is the expensive mark up on drinks in the bar I understand the overheads etc but even so ,0
 Did not like the same breakfast menu every day People with long stay gets bored with eating same thing again n again You need to change the menu on alternate days ,0
 No lock on bathroom toilet door Glass door that slides not much of an issue ,0
 I booked using this site and I admit it was a little last minute however my savings via the website weren t showing up on their systems and they were going to take the full price at first In my case they were quick to resolve the issue however it took much longer to resolve the same problem for my colleagues Also their system tried to take money from my card even after I had paid for my whole stay Be vigilant and check your card now and then during your stay ,0
 A bit chilly in the main areas because open plan is contiguous with the front doors to the hotel ,0
 The room service meal was very poor A half toasted cheese sandwich with cold fries I asked for fresh brown bread Way too expensive for the quality ,0
 The bar staff didn t explain they automatically added a discretionary service charge to each drink I questioned the price because it was 98 pence more than in the menu The barman was not happy and showed this when I asked him to remove the charge Service was slow and the bar staff were not engaged The bar was not busy at the time ,0
 I felt the breakfast was expensive and there was a long line on Sunday morning of people waiting to be seated However once seated the staff were extremely prompt and helpful ,0
 The only thing was the mattress on the sofa bed not thick enough ,0
 Would have to say thought the bar prices were a bit steep even for London nearly 5 for a juice ,0
 Not a bad experience but would suggest 2 armchairs in a double room would be handy instead of 1 especially if staying in room for a while and not wanting to lie on the bed this is really nit picking as room was very comfortable ,0
 Rubbishy A C we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm I would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months Appreciate that lower Windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper Windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue,0
 Not a bad experience at all just a minor quibble Please replace tinned orange segments with real orange slices grapefruit at breakfast Also suggest replacing mackerel with smoked salmon ,0
 Breakfast was cold and 4 extra for my boyfriend to have eggs benedict meaning his breakfast cost 22 and he didn t eat off the buffet,0
 small room sliding frosted glass bathroom door which didn t give much privacy when using the toilet Contents of mini bar were too expensive breakfast at 15 a ahead is too expensive No natural light to room as window looked out to internal space,0
 The fact that there was dirty stinky socks in a cupboard And view to the train station,0
 Staff has a poor level of English no bathrobe and slippers were provided TV and phones inside are very old Paint coming off in some of the corners Cleaners were knocking my door very early in the morning which was inconvenient Overall poor value for money considering that I have paid 280 pounds for two nights ,0
 It was really busy and nosy so difficult to sleep if you are above the restaurant bar Avoid rooms over the left side although they do have the best views It is very expensive even the food and drinks We ended up going out for everything ,0
 Sliding glass door of the bathroom It doesn t fit the conception of Park Plaza in general Needs something better ,0
 The one thing I d say is if using the restaurant avoid the steak,0
 Poor checking in Rooms tired Wardrobe door didn t close No proper shower tray Supposed to be Suite with London Eye view but could only see top of it and no skyline view,0
 Room was not cleaned until very late afternoon Bathroom floor was very wet after using the shower as the shower screen was not adequate Room also felt quite cool with no way of increasing the temperature ,0
 Elevators at rush hour Temperature and air not easy to regulate in internal rooms ,0
 Bar staff took forever to serve me and then was threatened with being thrown out when I complained Customer service non existent Manager apologized and gave me a bowl of fruit but by then the damage was done Cleaning staff threw away medicine from my room Safe did not work in my room Paid nearly 500 pound for a room on New Years Eve and breakfast not included ,0
 Breakfast items should change every so often Staying there for 13 days the same breakfast items got old,0
 The stay was awful Dirty room unhelpful staff and the room was too small for three people Not worth the money and very disappointing ,0
 The restaurant within the hotel had very slow service even when it wasn t particularly busy We had to ask the staff where the food was after waiting an hour When the food came it wasn t worth the wait ,0
 Rooms too warm even with a c turned to cool Disable accessible shower flooding the floor of ablutions esp arround toilet Design of panel allowing water to run out of shower ,0
 Very slow lifts Lots of guests taking the stairs The room for a junior suite was a little tired ,0
 Internet TV was hopeless sound and picture were not in sync and no amount of rebooting etc would cure this The shower in the room had no edge to the shower tray meaning water went all over the bathroom floor Hopeless design fault Offered a high floor room and disappointed to discover it was internal with no views at all ,0
 The double room was just a big single Had to pay for expensive soya milk to use with complimentary tea and coffee Drinks at bar very expensive Extremely high sided bath made using the shower potentially dangerous,0
 had to queue for breakfast on the Saturday for quite awhile and was a bit hectic tables very close together,0
 Still think the price is a little high I did get a deal on my stay but still thought it a little expensive overall,0
 I asked for three beds for three men and we were given only 2 beds one rolled over sofa which was extremely uncomfortable Rusty taps in bedroom Very loud aircondition Even our executive room was tiny And we paid a lot of money for this discomfort ,0
 In floor one especially room number 107 it is very noisy and couldn t sleep at night because of the continuous noises coming from the service lifts One of the managers and some of the reception staff are very rude and impolite and I can add more details in this regard if you want ,0
 Had to ask for sofa bed to be made up and extra towels although booked for 3 adults ,0
 We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a studio with a view of the London eye It was 25gbp per night but the view was obstructed and not worth the extra outlay in my opinion ,0
 Some staff could not speak English very well especially the woman that checked us out Cook had difficult time making eggs to order ,0
 Slow service in the bar early morning I wanted a coffee to go but simply didn t really want to serve opened a few cupboards looking for take away cups so I said I d leave it and I got one elsewhere ,0
 Light in wardrobe kept turning on even when doors are closed Location of toilet paper had to twist and lean down and it strained my back ,0
 Much further from train station than anticipated one say room was not cleaned completely but once discovered staff were speedy in rectifying situation ,0
 Hotel was a bit hot ,0
 I don t like having to pay a service charge thats forced on me by the bill in the bar area I always tip anyway We did have our money taken twice for the room but this was explained on our arrival as a 3rd party mistake Problem was rectified competently on arrival by the duty Manager and we were offered a free upgrade and complimentary drink which was nice Breakfast was extra and far too expensive even for a London Hotel ,0
 Bar service at a glacial pace ,0
 We only had two issues On the last morning of our stay the hot water wasn t working in the shower disappointing also we had room service for breakfast but the order only 80 correct ,0
 Shower room was a little small and the door opened inwards and brushed the edge of the toilet It was spotless and well equipped so I am being a little picky ,0
 The mattress on the sofa bed in the studio was filthy with at least five horrid blood stains The shower hose was leaking and the sink was dripping on to the scales stored under it Needless to say the scales had long stopped working as a result as they were soaked in water ,0
 Being a club Carlson member and having upgraded the room on arrival for an additional 60 total of 240 to include breakfast and a view I would have expected more than a pair of slippers No dressing gowns only three tea bags only two tissues in box in bathroom and a duvet which only just covered the bed On arrival at breakfast we were told we had not pre paid and subsequently seated on a table totally surrounded by other tables guest bags etc so you weren t able to get out without inconveniencing people by asking them to move No explanation of how the buffet worked and no offer to top up tea This is a shame as we have stayed here on a number of occasions previously and experienced fantastic second service ,0
 Only one member of staff that we dealt with had English as their first language resulting in us struggling to understand them and them most certainly not understanding us We also found someone else s dried urine on the loo seat upon arrival We contacted housekeeping but they didn t understand us so it wasn t rectified until we had yo go to reception and complain ,0
 Breakfast are was very cramped and the food quality was below average sausages were not nice tasting fried egg had a hard yolk 2nd bed in the room was a sofa bed Very uncomfortable for 195 00 for one night Also the air con only worked on one side of the room and the hotel was extremely hot everywhere we went not just in the room ,0
 Did not like the 1st room we were given however without too much trouble we were able to change to a nicer room The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired far too many people for such a small restaurant not enough room to enjoy breakfast leisurely ,0
 Had to chase for room servicing day two and then not serviced very well decided to do it myself ,0
 The reception staff is not at all courteous After paying so much they need extra money for everything We asked for good view room they need extra money for it We asked for late check out they need extra money for it The hotel does not have a lobby for spending some time You sit in the caf and they want that we should order something so that they get money The rooms are so small I will not recommend this hotel to anybody ,0
 small rooms with the inside ones having windows onto the atrium were strange overlooked by passage way on other side of the atrium and claustrophobic with curtains for privacy and no connection to daylight,0
 Glass door into bathroom short bath incomprehensible shower controls mystery phone rings in morning,0
 Long queue for breakfast in the hotel but there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby ,0
 room not ready at 2pm checked in at 4pm No credit card was asked for at checkin caused a lot of issues when ordering drinks Once into room we waited 2 hours while it was cleaned IT WAS filthy dirt all over the bathroom ,0
 The alarm system was started at 11am and we left the hotel to the evacuation point and we were asking the hotel stuff but every one gives us a a different reason then in the day after at 10pm the alarm started again and then we left the hotel again but they told us it was a test Test at 10pm ,0
 No issues would recommend visit and stay to friends and others ,0
 The italian restaurant was a bit too low level with respect to the overall impression of the hotel inspite the Chianti was superb The Bar service was super lousy,0
 Fire alarm was working 2 times The first one was at 11 am and the second was at 11pm And they said it was test while they asked of evacuated and all the gust went to the evacuation point ,0
 Breakfast is the same all monring i stayed 5 nights and every morning you had same things little bit boring but ,0
 We stayed here 3 times during our holiday and a couple of the rooms on the lower floors were a bit tired soap holders falling out of the wall fridges that didn t work etc ,0
 The minuses were athough they did not influence me to give a goog review is that the restaurant may not be so expensive but we had room service once had a basic pizza and it was horrible and it costed 35 The second situation was in the hotel bar when the waiter took our order we waited 20 minutes for a drink and again waited after he renturned for the second time ,0
 We dropped our luggage off early which we were told is not a problem but when we checked in later we were told that our luggage had been taken to our room but had not It then took 3 calls to reception and a wait of 3 4hr for it to arrive making us late for our evening meal ,0
 For our visit the hotel was rather overcrowded because of half term Long waits for the lifts and long queues for breakfast Although we hoped for a view over the river we looked over Waterloo Station ,0
 Wasn t given a good room room had no view or window to outside so was claustrophobic Was charged twice so wasn t able to access my money I specifically bought for my trip ,0
 poor view from our room 2nd floor to a car park bins sofa bed for kid should have a thicker mattress,0
 The bed it was a little flat futon looking and not very comfortable ,0
 I booked a family room for 2 adults 2 children ages 11 12 but on arrival I was given a standard superior double room with just 1 double bed 4 people on 1 bed was extremely uncomfortable Having travelled for almost 5 hours prior to getting to the hotel around midnight I was simply top tired to complain However my family I were very disappointed ,0
 I dined in the restaurant the food and house wine were of poor quality The lasagne gave me indigestion all night and what was described as a cheesecake was a mousse on a biscuit base The d cor crude black and white paintings of famous Italian scenes was appalling ,0
 bed was not the most comfortable inside room so no natural daylight,0
 No view we looked right into the back of waterloo station But we were not in that much to look at the view so it was nt really important We did not have breakfast as it was very expensive which was a shame ,0
 One of the staff blocked amount from the credit card as it is prepaid mastercard without asking that she will do that However I was planning to pay all amount in cash as well as she charged from the card deposit amount without informing us This is impolite and unethical way ,0
 The only thing wrong was the height of the bath tub as I am not very tall 5 ft 0 and I hurt myself getting in and out of the bath and has a result my legs has bruises on the front and back ,0
 Room wasnt ready had to wait 40 mins was offered a free drink but only beer or wine we got a flat glass of Prosecco expected better considering 600 for 2 night stay had to pay extra for breakfast 18 a head too,0
 Noisy dark rooms fruits from breakfast spoiled personal didn t realy care the spa sauna and steam bath very small and DIRTY just no fun at all Absolutely TOO EXPENSIVE for what you get ,0
 Room was small highly overpriced and noisy Bathroom looked tiered and time for a change or refed Not worth the price paid never again ,0
 Room was small Air con did not work Poor check in Breakfast luke warm Damaged hair dryer replaced Staff unsure of breakfast payment and aggressively interrupted our food Terrible phone service when questioned by customer service ,0
 Bed uncomfortable too hard probably past its sell by Food drinks very expensive ,0
 Room a little small Extremely high step to get into the bath shower ,0
 While the room was good enough for our short visit Its inside facing position would have been disappointing for a longer stay ,0
 A world of difference between the outward city view facing room and the internal room with its futuristic lift and darkness Ask for the city view when booking ,0
 Tables for breakfast are too close for every ones comfort A little too far from London underground stations to walk with suitcases A large lounge area would be great ,0
 The 12 5 surcharge that is in the small print Any tips should go to the staff and not back to the company coffers This is not fair and not clearly stated ,0
 The design and layout of the toilet make less sense since the flush button is behind the lavatory cover and the toilet paper rolls are quite inconvenient to reach But after all it is not a problem ,0
 Overly priced for a 4 star hotel even in good location 15 per person per night for breakfast ,0
 Issue with the room choice We paid extra for a city view got to our room to find a view of train station which wasn t pleasant Complained at reception to get a response saying u can see the shard barely could She then went on to say they were nearly fully booked We still weren t happy so she spoke to the manager and he said we could upgrade and get a better view for just 20 which we weren t happy for as we had originally paid extra for a view that we never got to have to pay even more Breakfast busy took forever to get a fried egg that someone stole our seats never got offered tea or coffee after asking someone for tea they brought over with no milk so had to ask again ,0
 Booked the penthouse great views but room in the small side considering the price,0
 No fridge it is only for extras ,0
 To long to check in and the sounds coming up from the restaurant woke me and my friends up at 6am Saturday morning and Sunday morning the radio was so pound that I thought that someone was having a party the spoiled the week end for us,0
 Room was internal with no natural light and a windows overlooking restaurant Fine for a night but no longer ,0
 Didn t dislike anything but would be helpful to have more glasses in the room Bar is ok but not a touch on Park Plaza Westminster Bridge next door ,0

 couldnt find anything ,0
 Staff were terrible on check in We arrived late and last minute so booked on bookings com beforehand When we arrived they said their system hadn t updated and we were then treated like an inconvenience despite showing booking references and confirmations One receptionist even pulled faces and thought it was funny More training of late night reception staff Interestingly the trainee receptionist was actually the most personable of them all ,0
 How cold it was in London ,0
 Originally booked a room with twin beds for my granddaughter and me However the only window faced an interior wall no way to tell the weather So I had to change the accommodation ,0

 We were disappointed that breakfast wasn t included in the price of the room as considering the price was almost 200 per night Also I was charged for 3 adults in the room when in fact there was only one adult and 2 children ,0
 Staff was extremely slow to respond to requests for assistance sometimes taking them hours to fulfill a request 1658 for 3 days in which I sat in a hotel room because I hurt my back assisting one of your employees get the curtains untangled from the balcony door,0

 Booked a twin room was given a double room They did change but should not of happened,0
 Room very small,0
 Breakfast was served on cold plates and cooked food went cold too quickly,0
 The spa was very disappointing Just 5 cheap beds round the pool Nowhere else to sit The treatments weee nice but not good value for money,0
 The shower cubicle in the bathroom was very small for this rating of hotel don t drop anything The great water pressure made up for the lack of space in shower though ,0
 Tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them I feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger,0
 Considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed The furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned You can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom All in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room Breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about Would definetly choose another hotel in London next time ,0
 The really noisy flushing toilet which was like you get on an airplane and so loud I was woken by the plumbing in adjoining rooms,0
 Although I have commended the breakfast it was possibly a little over the top There really was more food than anyone could sensibly require My niece had to ask for her pillows to be changed as she has an allergy to goose and duck down Replacements were provided immediately and without question but were far too big The staff s anxiety to please is perhaps a little overpowering for people like us who are not wealthy but can manage an occasional special treat ,0
 I understand that room rates are high in this part of London and that One Aldwych is a very high standard hotel with 24hr room service but I felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices However the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices ,0
 Having to leave Wish we could of stayed longer ,0
 I think the staff were a little too suggestive in having extras but this was minor we had a fruit side plate for breakfast but didn t really need this so ended up not eating it ,0
 Noisy kids in pool meant I didn t go in but it was Easter so to be expected I guess ,0
 Room very small wardrobe access in particular small Shower access over the bath not easy for one of us being over 70 years young a room with a walk in shower is quite a bit more expensive The lounge facilities for residents is limited ,0
 Outdated room design much nicer in pictures than real life was very disappointed expected it to be nicer for a 5 star hotel Loud plumbing noises in bathroom after use of water ,0
 The bed was too hard Thats all ,0
 For what iv paid 575 for 1 night didnt even gt a breakfast we could av been told that thers a safe in room the chair in 403 was disgustig filthy wasnt very impressed with the service,0
 Incredibly noisy Miniscule bedroom Broken toilet Water issue Plumber finally fixed it at 2am Key for adjoining room opened ours at the same time Guided to sit infront of lift when having a drink in the bar Receptionist in the morning a complete robot Knew we d had a terribly night Instead of starting off with an apology she asked if we d had a good night I commented that there were a few issues to which she replied oh yes I heard For 350 night and 18 glass of fizz I don t expect the adjoining room to open my door have a waterfall in the middle of the night nor do I expect to relax sip champagne in front of a lift shambolic faulty towers ,0
 The breakfast was not up to the level of the rest of the experience at this hotel Expensive and not tasty Slow service,0
 I booked five nights and each night I was charged a different rate I booked my stay through booking com Although the booking site mentioned a daily rate I was very disappointed that at the time of check out the front desk charged me 5 different rates I wonder who s responsible for this lapse Hotel or the booking engine OTA ,0
 The walk in shower was pretty tiny ,0
 Leaving,0
 Breakfast to order not ideal for young children even part buffet would help Film projection in pool great idea but unfortunately you can t really see it ,0
 Toilet blocked and drains noisy Would have preferred a walk in shower as rim of bath far too high for short person to step into ,0
 The staff were a little over attentive although very polite At lunch I felt uncomfortable as the staff were coming over what seemed like every 15mins ,0
 Pillows were terrible a five star hotel should have a selection of pillows to choose from Our hotel room door lock was missing so it didn t feel very secure The bathroom was quite tired and old fashioned plus the pump was noisy Cocktails were expensive and although tasty lacked much alcohol The hotel bar and restaurant were not that of a five star hotel and lacked ambience The pool was average again a little tired and the health club did not feel like that of w five star hotel ,0
 We arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and I specifically wanted and booked twin beds The lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough Evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative Car to airport did not arrive Agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least 20 minutes prior to getting into a cab I personally checked on the car about 10 minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which I found unusual for Great Britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there I felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask 10 minutes later Hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility ,0
 No wow factor and there was one waiter that did all the things you shouldn t do as a waiter at breakfast leaning across you etc,0
 It did take 3 attemps to get firm pillowes for are beds They need to be a bit more clearer some were be it on the web sight or checking Iin about the extra surcharge put on hold on the credit card I did get confused ,0
 Room was quite small for a luxury double and the bathroom was quite basic with small single wash basin and basic small glass enclosed shower ,0
 The water saving toilet flush is very loud in the middle of the night But better for the environment ,0
 Actual bedroom was a little small but to be fair it had all the necessary resources ,0
 To have been offered the 3 for 2 nights offer by the hotel which we were unaware of as we would loved to have stayed another night ,0
 A possible inconvenience for business travellers is that the in room safe is not large enough for a laptop,0
 The Foyer bar was lovely but gets very busy no where else as a guest to go and chill out if full,0
 Small grumble We had the afternoon tea However there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the BAFTAs so we had to eat in the general dining area I think we should have been told that when we booked Then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners No one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there ,0
 My wife had a poor cut of meat when in the restaurant but when we advised the staff the whole issue was handled very well ,0
 From the moment you arrive reception staff are rude unfriendly and in the bar area the staff ignored us for 30 mins then when we sat at a empty reserved table as we only wanted one drink before we went to dinner we were kicked off the table in an abrupt manner we went to the bar area couldn t get served left after 20 mins table still sitting empty Will never return,0
 One little point I had for milk for my tea every day of a 4 night stay ,0
 No bad experience but surely this quality of hotel should provide complimentary tea coffee water in rooms on arrival ,0
 I say this after every visit but please put tea and coffee making facilities in every room and an iron Very cheap B and Bs do this so why not an exclusive hotel ,0
 Not much choice of food on the room service menu Would have liked hot chocolate in addition to tea and coffee in room ,0
 Room quite small TV faced 90 degrees to the Bed so no possibility of watching it Wardrobe light would not go off Bathroom very noisy when other floors used their Needed better soundproofing in the bathroom Bedroom was fine ,0
 The serving of the breakfast took a long time The dining room was very cold air condition ,0

 The bar was too busy to serve us on Saturday evening,0
 I would prefer a breakfast buffet Quality of food far breakfast did vary from day to day ,0
 For the same cost I had a much smaller adjoining room than my daughter in law and granddaughter and for that reason I felt I should have paid less ,0
 room was small,0
 Restaurant and bar closed Sunday evening not informed in the website Water in the room first night only why do hotels charge a lot for the room then not leave water complimentary in the room We were told to walk to the shop at 10 pm for water ,0
 Wifi was very weak I was able to get it on my laptop computer but could not get connection on my iPad or iPhone ,0
 The bed is supposed to be king size and actually it is very small and uncomfortable Too much nose because of contraction that they did not warned me about it which they should inform me once I booked The staff are very rude You asked them for a missing item in the room kleenex towel toothbrush etc they had an attitude ,0
 The lifts are a bit small so big suitcases might be a problem ,0
 Staff was friendly but could be slightly more helpful when asking some directions for a good place to eat Missing a bar or place for a drink Limited shops and restaurants in the direct area unless you cross over to the High Street Champs drinks in the minibar are overpriced 6 for a simple coke but this is a more Paris issue in general perhaps ,0
 Can t think of anything we didn t like ,0
 The WiFi was extremely poor There are a limited number of logins allowed shared across the entire hotel You would have to keep refreshing the login page and hope that someone logged out of the WiFi or turned it off so that you could get connected ,0
 There are not many facilities like swimming pool or gym and the different areas are very smal like the breakfast room the lobby or the bar Not hot food for breakfast ,0
 The breakfast was too expensive and 25 euros meant that I never got to try the breakfast ,0
 All good but if the breakfast was included it would have been perfect The room was very good on 3rd floor and balcony view of The Arch ,0
 WiFi was not working for half of my 5 day stay,0
 The breakfast hot breakfast items need to be refreshed more often eg at 0900 the bacon was crispy,0
 Bed too small for a double Way over charging during the Euro 2016 Championship but I guess all other hotels in Paris where doing the same ,0
 Breakfast not included cleaning lady frequently ignored do not disturb sign even though we complained about it at the front desk ,0
 Staff member being loudly told off by lady manageress i assume she was right but not in front of client never do that Saturday evening at 11pm left outside of hotel door locked desk unmanned not good ,0
 The bed was a bit hard but that s probably personal preference ,0
 The room photos on the website do not entirely correspond to reality because only newly renovated rooms are shown but we received an older room although very clan ,0
 Cleaning staff changes our staff locations for example my wife arranged her makeup on the disk the moment we arrived but the cleaners take it and put it in the bathroom Very expensive compared to the service and the room and the facilities in the hotel The room was so small Very hot room there was no air conditioning in the hotel and they refused to open the A C because the manager closed it until our last night they opened it ,0
 The breakfast was really expensive 25 per person,0
 loud nights during the weekends people screaming shouting from nearby bars,0
 The wines provided are terrible and expensive 17 for half bottle We were very disappointed specially because France is famous for good wine We opened 2 bottles rose and red and only had a sip as it was horrible We were also charged for a bottle of white wine which we didn t have Although we do think they charged us by mistake and we didn t realised while checking out to ask them to remove it ,0
 the beds was little uncomfortable,0
 Leaving ,0
 Change the carpet in the halls for wooden floor please ,0
 no privacy there s no lock on the door so we couldn t lock it the house keeping staff entered the room while we were sleeping and we got panic elevators are pretty small ,0
 The lobby smell and the redecoration during our stay Small lobby with no space and facilities ,0
 One receptionist did not speak English and made it difficult to communicate requests All other employees were very helpful and accommodating ,0
 Every things were perfect The staff were so friendly and the location was even wonderful,0
 The view from the window didn t match the price we paid for the room,0
 No downsides that I can think of ,0
 The bed was too small I don t think it s made to fit 2 people,0
 The restaurant does not work sundays,0

 Rare for one of my posts but no faults zero the perfect stay ,0
 I can t find any faults ,0
 There were no outlets in the bathroom Police sirens were loud at night but weren t frequent Very quiet otherwise Don t use the elevator if you re claustrophobic We squished 2 adults and a 50 lb child but more as a challenge ,0
 Everything was great ,0
 Bath towels are the size of a face towel For an American Hotel I would have thought that they would have had bath towels fits for the average American I am not American who are rather larger than the average European ,0
 Very small thing I m short the side of the tub shower combo was a bit tall to climb over ,0
 Slightly slow internet ,0
 The air conditioner stopped working but the staff were very apologetic and gave us a fan for our room and a complimentary breakfast ,0
 No mini bar no slippers no toothbrush a bit disappointing for a 4 stars hotel ,0
 The place could do with a revamp but they don t need to try harder because they have the traffic anyway,0
 The room was small the elevator was quaintly small and the staff s directions were correct but not always easy to follow For example they would say turn right then go until the street ended then turn right and what you wanted was right there But they wouldn t know the names of the street or tell you that right there meant cross a major street and go 1 or 2 blocks ,0
 Not really a restaurant or bar but opposite the hotel there is a fantastic wine bar and there are plenty of restaurants in the area to explore ,0
 The elevator is small ,0
 Elevator could be bigger but that s only because the age of the building We managed ok ,0
 The housekeeping was a little flaky Face towel disappeared and never returned Milk wasn t topped up Room was small but Parisian hotels usually are Double glazing would be good despite being on 7th floor there was noticeable street noise We had a really good deal on the price I do not know if I would have been so happy paying full price ,0
 I really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating My room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room I saw No drinking water in the room or fridge Staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day BEFORE my check out like I was a thief or something similar and I felt very uncomfortable about this I travel for work every week and I have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time I felt this way The location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper ,0
 Shower enclosure in bathroom did not prevent the bathroom from flooding each time I took a shower ,0
 Limited interaction with hotel staff more to do with the position and height of the reception desk relative to the exit ,0
 Breakfast costs 16 euros but is quite limited no fruits and vegetables are not fresh but most people go for breakfast at nearby cafes anyway ,0
 Room is cleaned a bit late in the day after lunch ,0
 All great for me thanks ,0
 No shower door so the bathroom got very wet after showers,0
 We had requested a quiet room The room we had 404 was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors It meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants Luckily they were not too noisy people It should not have been allocated to us If they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space ,0
 Room is small but is normal in Paris Facility is a little bit old but kept clean and everything works ,0
 We were told we got upgraded on arrival to the Eiffel tower view room wow great In we go into the smallest elevator ever 2people max to the top floor The room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the Eiffel tower for what that was worth What they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing I mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor Crazy We informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the Eiffel tower from the balcony So much for upgrades,0
 Lacking on the fine details some TLC will help but it doesn t bother or hinder the experience at all one just notice those things ,0
 The wifi was quite slow at times It seems to be unusable depending on the time of day when hotel guests were around ,0
 Size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for 2 people The 2 beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person ,0
 Some Staff could be more friendly and a proper lounge with a bar to relax in would have been nice Bathroom was very jaded and shower over bath had a slippery surface ,0
 In the closet was dust I had to clean hangers at first and then put my things,0
 A lovely well placed hotel I was however only able to afford it when on offer ,0
 I think the price for Breakfast at 16 euros per day is too expensive but you wont find anything cheaper nearby ,0
 In both the rooms we have stayed in it was difficult to take a shower without flooding the entire bathroom ,0
 Staff rude I had pre paid before we had arrived When we got to the hotel because we didn t have the credit card used we had to pay cash on arrival there was no need for this as the room was already payed for so we had to pay twice Hotel is quite old fashioned not up to 4star standards rooms are very small also bathroom Wouldn t return again ,0
 Could only have the Continental Breakfast in your room Dont understand why Room was pretty compact though comfortable not sure where i would have put the breakfast see above,0
 Room claustrophically small Very dark decor Even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map Lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out If you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space Handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one Safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it Skimpy small hard towels in bathroom Hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions On line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large It s a very small lobby and maximum 2 suitcases and 2 people in elevator Hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway This was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls A few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room We d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard We made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use Was ok for purpose used but not one I would recommend to others ,0
 The Bathroom could be better designed ,0
 Only thing I can complain about was that the batteries were dead in the Remote ,0
 Room Service was overly expensive More than nice fine dining and when we tried to book airport shuttle times were not convenient ,0
 The ceiling in the room was leaking water in two spots in the toilet and beside the air conditioning The cleaning service threw away a hair conditioning of ours and the hotel did not have one to replace it Also there were many bags of garbage from the cleaning service blocking the lift s door and in the middle of the corridor Not very pleasant at all In the Eve s overnight the card did not open the reception door and we got stuck outside the hotel for 10 minutes at a negative temperature until someone opened the door ,0
 Breakfast staff considering the rates for breakfast did not do enough e g direct customers to the coffee machine and milk ,0
 Room is a little bit too small ,0
 On the first day we arrived internet was really good but for the other days I cannot say that it was fast Also hair dryer isnt good if you have thin hair that dries slowly as mine you have to bring your own ,0
 The room was too small for the price the heat didn t work we had a heater to keep us warm no slippers for a 4star hotel ,0
 Decaf espresso is not available for breakfasr,0
 All was good,0
 Room not well sound proofed Internet spamodic difficult ss business trip ,0
 The shower should have had a bigger glass partition to keep water from getting on the floor We had trouble getting clean face cloths every day ,0
 The bathroom was outdated and dirty with mouldy tiles dirt around the toilet parts and peeling and cracked paint bodged tiles The bedroom was lovely but extremely dusty I had to use wet wipes to dust the bed head etc as I have a dust allergy and was kept awake the first night coughing In the day light I realised why ,0
 Room very small dark and rather claustrophobic Bed at an angle to fit it in the tiny room Bed pretty small too Room was hot and although window opened it faced on to back of building with all the noisy air conditioning and heating boilers ,0
 Room was a little small but that wasn t really a problem you trade that for the great location anyday ,0
 I wanted to give another guarantee card than the one I had prepaid with and the guy at the desk was new and demanded that I repay my booking with the new card Which I did and they reimbursed me on the initial card but I suffered a foreign exchange supplementary cost of 15 ,0
 Small rooms Smelly corridors No soundproof Fake pictures on the offer There are superior classic rooms and superior delux classic are actually former rooms of the servants with separate staircase etc etc,0
 The lift I don t think I d want more than two people at a time or one plus one case Personally I wasn t prepared to chance it so I walked up and down the four flights of stairs Every time Bed not very comfy Ordering room service time consuming and only after doing so and having to wait 45minutes for order did we realise it was outsourced and not done by hotel ,0
 Rooms are very outdated old furniture nasty bathrooms which need a complete overhaul lighting extremely poor Rooms small by U S standards Hotel rating too high for such poor quality and facilities ,0
 Air conditioning was quite poor at 25 degrees it was way too cold We preferred to open the window but it s not always an option dust noise Lightning might be better bed lights high above the bed and no ceiling lamp and lightning above the mirrow in the bathroom for doing make up ,0
 Rooms were a bit small but it s Paris so this was expected ,0
 yes it is paris style but the room and the elevator seem really too small ,0
 Bathroom a little cramped but to be expected for this age of building Staff at reception were excellent ,0
 Room is small They don t have their own parking space but on street its available ,0
 No complaints ,0
 The receptionist was impersonal eg asked me if i liked Paris but couldnt care less about my answer poor qulity toilet paper terrible quality long life milk in rooms dark rooms with deep red decor gloomy ,0
 The bathroom was very small and the lift was slow and small The room while not huge was ok for Paris ,0
 The breakfast was too widely spread it took a while to realise how much choice there was,0
 Door was a little touchy Tried not to wake entire hall,0
 No free parking as stated when booked only a public car park which cost us 64 for 2 days Breakfast was not included in the price even though it was suggested this was the case at check in 32 for 2 people a day is an absolute rip off ,0
 Narrow hallways and staircases tiny elevator and you still have to go up and down a half flight of stairs This was okay for us but those with mobility issues or a lot of heavy luggage might have problems ,0
 Tables were not cleaned up and the buffet was not replenished Staff totally indifferent Had to ask several times for items like bread yogurts Very small elevator hardly enough for two Certainly not enough room for a suitcase ,0
 I was really unhappy when there where no tables ready for breakfast Staff was hiding in a kitchen and did not clean tables and did not prepare tables for new guests I start to prepare table myself as there were nobody to ask for help Lady in charge appears in fey minutes and start to follow her duties Next time I will avoid to have breakfast in this hotel ,0
 Some minor things beds a little hard a bar fridge in room would have been good carpet in need of some repair in entry to room ,0
 Very thin wall If someone who cannot pay attention to the neighborhood unfortunately stays in the next to your room that s too bad I tried to be patient but I finally knocked the wall at 2 AM in the midnight in order to stop happy laughing British English conversation I could not use the air conditioner because I found a lot of black mold in it then I did not feel good ,0
 Very small lift The room was small for 3 people but adequate via European standards ,0
 I had a room on the top floor which actually gave me a rooftop view of Paris Unfortunately it was like being in an attic the sloped roof took up half of the small room It was difficult to navigate around the very hard bed to get to the wardrobe and I had to stand on a chair to use the safe It was also extremely hot even with the air conditioner running all of the time The windows did open but with no screens there were issues with mosquitos and birds flying in I didn t change my room because I didn t spend much time in it ,0
 Breakfast could be a little better Limited choice ,0
 Room was a bit on the small side had no view ,0
 The room was a little on the small side the selection on offer at breakfast could have been better The breakfast offerings was also a bit scattered not everything was positioned in the same area of the room It would have been nice to have fresh drinking water in the room every day not just on the first day More information about excursions in the room would have been good,0
 its location is really good so street noise is variable even with the great windows ,0
 Dim lighting would have liked a brighter light near to the desk ,0
 Didn t like not to be able to get extra pillows when we requested them ,0
 Walls are really thin And you can clearly hear everything from the surrounding rooms ,0

 the shower curtains is too easy to leak to the bathroom floor even if you put it into the tube it still leak ,0
 Changing the club lounge rules especially removing the complimentar access for royal ambassadors members ,0
 Breakfast was not good I had the advocado toast and it was tasteless My daughter had the potatoe rosti and it was awful soggy and greasy ,0
 Been stopped by the door man and asked to produce our room keys to prove we were stopping there Stereotyping due to tattoos ,0
 Well Although I liked my breakfast it was not included in the room charge ,0
 Avoid the dingy standard rooms facing the courtyard Soviet style views dated and worn furnishings and subpar luxury ,0
 The Intercontinental breakfast was kind of limited in terms of options especially for the price charged In the room the espresso machine didn t work or I couldn t find out how ,0
 I have stayed here occasionally over 5 years The breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling The cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs The magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else There used to be an omelette area that s gone too For warm food you have to choose off Theo Randall s Italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices If the food we had was a reflection don t even bother The fried rosti tasted like a brick Service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor If this is IHG s flagship hotel in London then unfortunately the 5 star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast I guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs Go across to the Serpentine caf for a better breakfast Also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies So beware if you are not so mobile We will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in London in the future ,0
 Breakfast buffet has poor selection of foods and I had to pay 27 for the toast and butter I had Breakfast wasn t included in the booking,0
 Not enough coffee in our room only 3 packets so one of us couldn t have a second cup The coffee supplied at Breakfast the following morning was COLD and had no taste of coffee whatsoever ,0
 I asked for a quite room but since the room I booked was of a standard higher than regular I was given a bigger but louder room facing busy street I had to change at 1 am in the morning ,0
 The room s view location The staff should informed me during the checking in that the room will view to the intrnal yard Which I may ask them for upgrade,0
 The bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use ,0
 1 Bed quality is poor King size bed is simply 2 singles joined Pillow choice and mattress is poor 2 No free wifi 3 Room size not great for price,0
 They didnt clean my room for 2 days even though i called them to confirm about cleaning and tidying the room Also i didnt have the Clean My room door hanger nor the don t disturb one ,0
 I was disappointed with the Spa you could only use it if you paid for a treatment We only wanted to go in for half an hour to freshen up but were unable to do so ,0
 They didn t clean the room one day Had to call 4 times for someone to bring shampoo Ordered Croissants to my room at 7 00 am and they were dry ,0
 This hotel needs to match the breakfast to the quality of the hotel ,0
 Our iron in the room didn t work Not a big deal but I would have like to run it over my dress before dinner ,0
 I asked for early check in but the room was not ready and we had to wait a while ,0
 The room was below expectations Although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street When we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full Having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com For this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity It was a definete disappointment on our part My advice is either pay a bit more and prefer 4 seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton They re all 100meters away from each other Having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm ,0
 My biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests Rarely have I spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals Yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me The rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay ,0
 Breakfast a little frantic restocking of bowls for fresh fruit and even butter at the breads table,0
 The rooms soundproofing is not very good because sometimes I hear sounds coming from the rooms while I am walking to my room ,0
 Very small amount of milk in room we had to ask for coffee pods too ,0
 The room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it The toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down We ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if I ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental The taste was disgusting I swear I wanted to vomit after I ate the first bite Our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for 591 instead of 561 for that night ,0
 Air conditioning a bit noisy ,0
 It was perfect for us on a one night stay,0
 Could have been more than 2 Nespresso pods if you are a couple it would be great to maybe have 2 decaf 4 regular pods but then again not many hotels have a Nespresso machine in the room to begin with ,0
 Bus stop is at 2 minutes walk to Hilton H No supermarkets nearby ,0
 Room was too hot both windows open heating low as we could get it so hot my partners asthma was set off and he was up all night as he couldn t lie down had to have water from minibar to cool himself The receptionist let us have the water and advised us that next time to call reception to help,0
 Our room was very warm even with A C and didnt have the best view The Mini Bar in the fridge was VERY expensive 3 50 for a KitKat and 5 for a 500ml bottle of water though I guess that the majority of Patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water The Buffet style Breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around Also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication ,0
 10 for two small bottles of water was a bit steep given everything else is excellent value Could hear the guest next door easily at night ,0
 towels smells not nice receptionist not fully respect the ambassador golden card I was carried by designating low quality room ,0
 Room was small for the price and not well fitted i e no hooks to hang things up A free bottle of water would have been a nice addition,0
 Wifi is not free The wifi cost could have been included in the room price Unfortunately I couldn t to get access to the wifi It didn t work smoothly ,0
 Room and in particular the bathroom is a tight squeeze for 2 people and from this perspective I don t think the hotel offers good value for money We also experienced extremely poor service at the Arches Bar which given that we were out celebrating a special occasion affected our evening and would be enough to say we wont be returning ,0
 Breakfast service and food quality not the best for this kind of hotel Personal note poor phone reception 5 for small bottle of evian ,0
 Service Very slow We were at Gin and Jazz and one of the young male waiters just shrugged when we chased the already late wine Earlier in the day we ordered 2 glasses of champagne in the bar and it took ages to arrive We ordered 2 glasses of champagne in our room which took 30 mins to arrive ,0
 This time I had a number of issues during my stay namely There were no slippers or bathrobe in the room There was no complimentary water the mini bar was absolutely empty All my cosmetics testers as I came for 2 days only were thrown away by the housekeeping,0
 Staff is not as expected from such a great name of a hotel Lack of experience lack of knowledge and I strongly believe they need so much in training ,0
 The rate is over priced The breakfast end at 10 00AM would be better if its 11 00AM,0
 overcharged by hotel on room and i ended up paying for someone else room service hotel did not care and continued to charge my card ,0
 Poor service 3 days asking for something tell they send me Corridors are really dirty and we adked for cleaning but they didn t In the breakfast area the treatment is really auful they way they check your room number is like a school manager Wated so long to check in plus they refused to give us even 1hour for checkout althoug I explaned that I have doctor appointment and its hard to make it on 12pm but they didnt care Room service is the worst ,0

 As I said the coffee maker didn t work Apart from that I loved it ,0
 Oh hotel is quite nice but sorry to say the location is terrible not acceptable Hotel should have a shuttle for guests to take them to the closest metro station to avoid walking through the intimidating neighbourhood especially with kids ,0
 Location was far from airport and Trocadero where I wanted to mainly visit Also the breakfast was rubbish Hardly any variety ,0
 Hardly any tea coffee in the room and a charge at reception for more for the coffee machine The restaurant attached was very expensive and at night there isn t anywhere nearby to eat you need to take the metro to another area ,0
 There are a lot of migrants around the hotel sleeping in tents Because of the location you can t avoid to walk across these tents which is very scary together with your family One night we made a group of 4 adults at the nearest metro station to get to the hotel safely It is very crazy and it will be worse and worse ,0
 Location is the downside there are a lot of refugees outside HOWEVER it is not as severe as any of the reviews I have seen previously Yes there are quite a lot and I can see how some may be slightly intimidated There are only quite a lot on the walk to the metro but we were never hassled nor stared at or made to feel uncomfortable Police presence further up away from the hotel where the refugees are ,0
 I didn t like the fact that it s located close to the refugee asylum seeker camp,0
 Saw a mouse small rat in or room on the last morning Terrible views from the room Unless you are a keen motorway and flyover spotter ,0
 Horrible location loud discotheque right under the hotel not so great breakfast on paper plates and cups the breakfast area is in the reception no soaps in the rooms the separate toilet room is very small Overall not worth the price at all ,0
 The location We stayed there so our son could walk to an event at salle Pullman les docks ,0
 The location was terrible I expected more from the Novotel brand I was very disappointed We booked and paid for 3 nights and left after one I have never felt so unsafe in my life ,0
 Staffs ,0
 staff not friendly enough tea bag sugar coffee etc only one provided in the room we are two no milk at all no regular tea bag only herbal tea there is no universal wall socket to charge phone or laptop all mainland european standard hotels must be universal they forced me to buy a converter for a one night use there are plenty of things to improve standard ,0
 Location is in a very economically depressed area There were over 30 homeless people sleeping near the sidewalk on the walk from the metro The rooms have paper thin walls I not only heard my neighbors conversations but also had a nightclub blaring music until 0200 in the morning It was so bad I could hear the words to the songs with my windows closed ,0
 Location of this hotel is very bad its not safe to travel in night time with kids in this area but metro is really close in 5 minute walk We use metro for all our visits ,0
 outside the hotel in neighbourhood there was too much mess poor housekeeping There were dozens of immigrants camps arround the hotel which is the main cause of mess in the surrounding area ,0
 The location of this hotel is horrible When we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood This hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around When we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station We felt very insecure Staffs were okay but I feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling Few of them were just lazy with their answers Also They don t really smile ,0
 The walk from the Metro to the hotel is fairly intimidating due to all the tents and refugees homeless people but everyone left us alone However would not recommend for single females especially at night ,0
 The area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless While we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe The hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc We did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel So this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there We opted to taxi in most of the time ,0
 Location has lots and lots of homeless people mostly from outside Europe Furthermore there is so much garbage lying around It is the worst neighbourhood I have seen in Paris One does not walk outside feeling safe Staff was friendly but some did not dress like a hotel employee but like tourists Breakfast was not well organized Dirty floor location of food not logical Mediocre food PAPER PLATES ,0
 There are a lot of homeless people living under overhead bridges across from the hospital We mainly used uber to travel to places ,0
 Location as such doesn t look safe specially at night Lot of people homeless near by not judging ,0
 Where do i start 1 Horrible location Even though it was walking distance from nearest metro Porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times 2 Its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons We reached hotel about 6pm we went to bed early about 7 30 to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic We spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything 3 Entrance Thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con ,0
 Where should I start This hotel is rated a 4 star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families The metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area It looks like a war zone The area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel It is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel You have to take taxi to ensure your safety I do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced I asked for a refund and management refused This hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in Paris,0
 the hotel should have highlight more clearly the location of the hotel it is near the overhead bridge where the refugees camp is lotsa of refugees camping under the bridge however sercurity was okay as every nights when we returned late to the hotel we saw police petrol at the area basically the refugees do not disturb the area smell bad though ,0
 Too noisy in the street by night Nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until 3 am Room too hot Area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel Would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant 10 min walk ,0
 Bathrooms are flooding when showering design fault Still they are clean and large Breakfast lacks vegetables ,0
 Terrible parking They let more cars in than there are places available which causes chaos and high risk of having car scratched Location of the hotel is also terrible hundreds of homeless people sleeping just outside so going for a walk is not a good idea I do not recommend this hotel to anyone especially for families ,0
 The location of the hotel isn t the best,0
 There were no travel cots available so baby slept on single bed mattress on the floor Nearby shops metro station were convenient though tent camp nearby was off putting to start with If you re paying on card with a foreign currency ask for a full receipt at checkout We re still waiting for one 3 weeks later and not sure if we ve been overcharged for something or if the exchange rate was not great ,0
 Hotel is located in very rough area of the Paris due to that We had to order unhealthy take aways Unable to explore and experience local area Travel via Uber expensive compare to the trains hotel does not have a restaurant so only choice you have is to order take away or take uber to some nice area to dine toilet is as small as the size of the plane toilet ,0
 the breakfast is very basic and the area around the hotel is scary and dirty I was travelling with wife and 2 kids I was looking around us every second to make sure no one was following us The reception area is the same area as the breakfast which is something I have never seen before,0
 location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine Especially one lady that was incapable of smiling I felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into Paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of Paris is not very good ,0
 Location was poor in a rough area with a sote for homeless people opposite Breakfast selection was poor Same selection every day Staff were not very receptive Room wasn t service properly at times and when missing items were requested they would not deliver them to the room you would have to go down and get them ,0
 Firstly it s located in a bad place Just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population It feels dangerous to go alone in the streets Facilities were ok As it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant But this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant They claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi Rooms weren t cleaned properly Someone s inner were lying inside my room Toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane ,0
 Location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible And in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people This made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night Breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options Hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e No tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room ,0
 the room was so hot I could not sleep overnight also the wifi was so weak I use my data the location was quite unsafe ,0
 Room appears clean but smelly Bad odour in corridors as well Breakfast was just as bad as not much to choose from Parking was expensive and difficult to get in and out The area where the hotel was situated seems dodgy Could not wait to get out of that place ,0
 The second bed was a bit decieving from the listing We thought we were getting a 2 bedroom suite when in fact the bedrooms are just separated by a curtain ,0
 causing a lot of inconvenience to us and my friend Again requested next day but invain had to come back spoiling our trip due to hotel zero cooperation no refund terrible ,0
 The location makes you feel unsecure There were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel The hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway ,0
 The location and neighborhood is less to be desired Graffiti everywhere dirty strong smell of urine reffugee camp under flyover Please look after your belongings when approached by beggers When traveling at night use VTCs type very reasonable price,0
 Two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up Surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people Area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts,0
 Area in which hotel is located is not the best one ,0
 The carpet had holes all throughout it where people had dropped cigerrettes on the floor It wasnt very pleasant to walk over Also asked restaurant staff if they could blend a banana and milk for my son and we was told nope No explanation why ,0
 Location though not the best is alright and not at all as bad as some visitors find it ,0
 We have 3 persons when I booking on this website they described this suite have two bedrooms but in fact only use transparent curtain to separate bed and lounge where put small sofa bed it is totally wrong info from booking com so we have to take one more suite when we checking in the outside of the hotel is terrible dirty and not safe feeling but near to airport and exhibition it is good for me ,0
 Restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room Our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there Very poor service ,0
 The area where hotel is situated looked a bit out of city it is near near motorways and recycling facility But then everything else about the hotel covered up for this tiny little shortfall ,0
 The location was terrible it was too far away from the sights area is run down Hotel wasn t easy to find even with sat nav and parking proved difficult to get in and out Breakfast in the hotel was poor quality runny snotty eggs were the only cooked item The same food was brought out that had been out the day before The same Stale quiche had been put out all three mornings I was there ,0
 The price is more relative to the location than the hotel Although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times A small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room This didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others ,0
 As a woman travelling on my own I thought the walk the metro wasn t pleasant I was also disappointed that the English language TV service in the room did not work as advertised ,0
 If you need to take the elevators you just need to wait for the cleaners they keep it busy doesn t matter if you are in rush,0
 very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood NEVER even try to book there there were people using DRUGS just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us The staff was not helpful and grumpy On top of this the TV was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators Later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of Paris right next to the dumping ground A BIG NO if you want to stay SAFE ,0
 Slightly small reception Basic breakfast parking not free although you pay a special rate of 18 euro all day ,0
 Air con didn t work properly They threw away my water bottle which was on the desk ,0
 Parking is super expensive Hotel staff really dishonest We had several times random expenses always ask for the detail of your bill ,0
 I booked for 3 guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for 1 person When explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately She would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and I received was one of the worst I have ever experienced I would never stay here again and I would not advise anyone else to stay here ,0
 A lot of reviews talk about feeling threatened or intimidated by the area certainly if 10 year old girls and old women begging scares you avoid St Denis is not the nicest of places but convenient for what I needed Avoid the scrambled egg truly awful but good selection otherwise for breakfast I and others took food away for later and no comment was made by staff Take coffee with you not a lot by the kettle ,0
 The toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell There is no aircon Lucky for us it was cool weather but I can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable The area is not safe We walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us We just kept walking faster and went into the metro station It was very scary as we had our 10 month old baby with us We are so grateful the man did not hurt us ,0
 Paying extra for parking The room was so warm we had to keep a window open so was noisy at night as it s located so close to a lot of roads Lots of people begging and living rough outside,0
 The surrounding area was at first sight alarming with rubbish strewn all around There also appeared to be a number of refugees and vagrants begging in the area which again at first was a little daunting ,0
 I could not fault anything ,0
 the manager of hotel wants to pay all the money there but in greece there is not the opportinity to take more than 480 euros per week and she didnt accept the card which we have already sent in order to pay the rooms ,0
 The location was not the best close to a metro line but a bit of a strange area,0
 The nearby garbage collection facility was not somewhere I want to see in Paris Although I did not experience any bad situation the neigborhood does not look secure ,0
 Is the worst possible location The hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter Not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station ,0
 The location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or Uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area There is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel Or maybe there s a secret passage that I missed who knows In any case after walking 10 minutes I felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro ,0
 Poor housekeeping service Housekeeping staff were not able to understand English Difficult to explain your needs ,0
 The bad part is the location a taxi driver was in shock when he brought us back from the centre of paris he said the area was very dangerous and it felt like that too ,0
 This is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe It was at times like walking through a war zone ,0
 Just the neighborhood is not so nice the way walikg to the metro we pass on places with garbage everywhere ,0
 Location of hotel is not the best hence the reason there s a security guard,0
 However the way to that about 10 minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel My family and I didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security I don t recomend ,0
 the location I would suggest the hotel to put a tip on their website on how to reach the hotel from the metro station when we first arrived we obviously have no idea which route we should take to reach the hotel and thus ended up walking pass a very dodgy rough and unsafe area more so when you walked at night,0
 The location is very poor There are homeless people living on the streets between the subway station and the hotel No taxis at the subway station you have to walk through a rough neighborhood There are prostitutes in same area Saw some fighting going on so we changed the street we walked on The view out the back from our suite was a vacated crumbling set of buildings with graffiti etc No Eifel tower views from my window ,0
 Location felt unsafe walking back from the metro at night under the underpass Would not recommend this Fine if you re travelling in a car as this hotel is right on the edge of intersecting motorways Not good if you re using it as a base to explore Paris attractions Stay somewhere else ,0
 As you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of Paris It is not far to get into town once you reach Porte de la Chapelle metro station but it is a decent 10 minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed Let s just say I wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless I am in a group of 5 guys There are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around Porte de la Chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there Gym needs to have some weights and a bench Aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups I suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay ,0
 very bad service the door card did not work twice have to go down from 7th floor to the service disks staff members don t feel any sorry about the door card did not work no sorry don t care customer s feeling,0

 Room to small which was difficult to navigate with 2 large suitcases Our room wasn t made up till about 4 30 in the afternoon even though we had been out for at least four hours earlier in the day ,0
 In relation to the view from the room was originally given a room in the basement window faced a wall Asked to move which they kindly facilitated and got a slightly smaller room on the 4th floor so I could see the sky but was looking out on a flat roof As they said the hotel was busy there wasn t much choice so I was happy that they moved us ,0
 Very small single room and an even smaller shower 2ft x 2ft square difficult to get in and out at my age 75 I am glad I was not obese To get to my room was by lift and stairs Not easy with a suitcase Staff helped,0
 The rooms were quite small even though we had a club room In particular the bathroom it was really small and the sink you couldn t even get your head near to brush your teeth and the tap that was on the sink was huge ,0
 We were not happy with the room it very small fortwo people it was difficult moving around each other as well has having our things in the way ,0
 There was an issue with pre payment authorizations however we did contact the hotel directly and they resolved the problem promptly,0
 None of the windows in the hotel open which can be a little stuffy in the rooms This isn t down the the hotel though as the building is listed and they can not change the windows ,0
 We were booked into a Superior room but the bathroom was accessed down steep stairs and that small that it was in my opinion dangerous ,0
 The furniture needs a bit of renovation Wanted to have their breakfast but the kitchen smell was all over the dining room So went to out ,0
 Views from windows Always ask for rooms with the view on Main Street Otherwise will get noisy neighbors and some kind of warehouse that starts business 6 00 in the morning ,0
 I m glad that I booked this room for 55 instead of close to 200 on the hotel s website ,0
 The only thing that bothered me was the size of the room With 2 people you couldn t pass each other That said all the good things and especially the location compensated this ,0
 The room was TINY for the price The room was only big enough room for a single bed and someone to stand next to the bed The window wasn t much bigger than a computer monitor and was in the top corner of the room similar to what I d imagine a prison to have I was on the very top floor it felt a bit like an attic room Great staff but just wouldn t stay again as I wasn t comfortable in the room ,0
 Room was so small and bathroom was even smaller Showering resulted in everything in sight being drenched no workable shower screen and pathetic shower headlike ,0
 The reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems Definitely I ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel When you ask reception that can I have a bottle of water You will got right away this answer We have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water Tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying Even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back You have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning ,0
 could not get the TV to work not overly concerned Room small but I guess that was to be expected and sufficient these are only minor items,0
 The bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat I had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good ,0
 The room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel We were told we were given an upgrade I cannot imagine what we were supposed to have Also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose The bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up The demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again There was very little thought put into these issues On the whole I feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn ,0
 liked everything ,0
 I paid for Club rate and the size of the room was tiny couldn t properly fit 2 suitcases in it Additionally there was only a really narrow small window A friend who paid for the same rate got a basement room with a terrible smell The room bathroom was not well cleaned and necessities such as shampoos soaps etc were not re filled added during our stay I am pretty sure that sheets were not changed either during our 4 day stay The carpet was poorly laid on top of an older one in a very obvious way Staff was not consistent with clients for example the same request book a room for an extra night had 2 different responses from 2 different staff members we cannot please book through the website and yes sure ,0
 The room doors don t have any padding to slow them down so during the evening everyone coming and going sounded like they were slamming their doors ,0
 Hot sandwich from room service was cold Tiny room but this is typical for London especially a single room ,0
 Service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at 11 15 at night and cost of breakfast ,0
 The room was very small and it was an upgrade I am a tiny person and I felt a little clausterphobic in the room The bathroom was incredibly small I would not recommend this hotel to someone who is on the larger side ,0
 sizes of room and toilets ,0
 The room had no windows which I know the hotel had no choice on but still did feel a bit suffocating Small issue though not a deal breaker And if they could only find a way to fit a mini bar in the room ,0
 The room was the smallest room i had ever seen It was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos The was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on It was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed ,0
 The rooms were tiny This was a deal breaker I do not recall seeing sizes when I booked but I acknowledge they may have been listed at that time I know they are listed now because I looked it up If we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical From what I can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms The single induced claustrophobia We usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc That was impossible in this hotel ,0
 They tried to move us to another hotel citing maintenance issues We refused and a room suddenly became available The rooms were not as grand as the reception area ,0
 Being double booked and asked to leave being rebooked into someone else s room and receiving no compensation for time lost and stress and inconvenience ,0
 the shower sprayed water everywhere ,0
 Rooms a little small but to be expected for the location and price otherwise fantastic ,0
 Noisy both out on the street and in the hotel Double bed was two single beds together ,0
 Deluxe twin booked A big deal made on checking in that we were getting upgraded to superior A bit insulting when we saw the tiny room with the twin beds with no gap between them If that was superior I d hate to see deluxe What on earth is standard like ,0
 Our room it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in it was not suitable for two people or fit for purpose I booked a Superior Double Room it was not a double and definitely not superior I had to lay on the bed if my husband wanted use the bathroom I have stayed in many hotels including in Paris and this is the smallest by far When we arrived at the hotel approx 9 30pm there were people in front of us at the desk who where been called taxis in order for them to be moved to a sister hotel due to maintenance issues which can only be construed as an overbooking issue Also we had to wait for our room to be fixed cleaned as it was not ready when we arrived so late in the day although we did receive a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience For the price we paid it was not value for money ,0
 The room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking The actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places Our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at In view of all this we felt it was very overpriced ,0
 The room was on the 7th floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night The room was the tiniest room that I have ever stayed in and I travel a lot to London and abroad The regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre I literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom The room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy The photographs within the booking details are misleading ,0
 When I landed in London I received a call from Grande Royale Hyde Park booked via your website They informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating After visiting another hotel Paddington Hotel which was more distant from the Hyde park and looked like it should have 2 3 star rating I went back to the Grand Royal and demanded the room Magically the room was available About 30 smaller in size than the one I booked Towels with hair on Sorry its far from 4 star Disaster ,0
 The only problem i felt was the double room was more like a single room so when i asked 2 be moved they were helpful 2 accomodete us with another room ,0
 By room could have been a little cleaner There were stains on the walls and on the lampshades ,0
 The room wasn t ready when we arrived fair play we were given complimentary drinks while we waited it s just a bit irritating paying all that money I wouldn t then expect to wait plus my friend is heavily pregnant so that made it more annoying and difficult for her after a long journey ,0
 Hotel was overbooked due to multiple people booking same day on booking com Hotel went above and beyond to accommodate us so all ended well ,0
 Hotel is a little tired in some public areas that need re painting ,0
 Some of the back stairs to the rooms could do with a bit of sprusing up Bar area also needs some touching up ,0
 Double room was a little cramped and would have preferred a bit more room but we had all the facilities we needed for a short 2 night stay ,0
 Our room was incredibly small The hotel rooms look lovely in the photographs but in reality seem a little tired and run down We paid a very reasonable rate for the room through Booking Com which was reserved several months in advance but we noticed that the general prices closer to the date were hugely inflated at prices that could not be justified for what you actually get Also the communal toilets in basement Not great when group of rowdy young men burst in when wife alone ,0
 We had booked one night in a twin room but were told on arrival that they only had doubles Staff offered a discounted second night as compensation but we were unable to take them up on this so still ended up paying the not insignificant full cost of the room for an uncomfortable night s sleep sharing a bed,0
 Tiny room and bathroom so small that the door couldn t open properly due to toilet behind it Lots of noise coming from outside and view of bins and rubbish from room window ,0
 Rooms are very small Could barely move around We weren t in it all that much but make sure you pay attention to the size of the room you are booking ,0
 Couch pull out bed The mattress was so old it sank to the middle and I had to hang on to the furniture beside the bed to pull myself out Also slept for the week with the bars under the mattress poking me in the back and leg Asked for different mattress but wasn t available Needed to just buy a new mattress and throw that one away The main bed was wonderful but I wasn t the one sleeping there unfortunately ,0
 We booked as it was stated that they had parking available which they didn t When we got to the property they had no twin rooms despite this being what we booked ,0
 My room had an insect problem but that was quickly resolved It s other things such as the drapes hanging off the rod and the dirty wallpaper and carpeting that were concerning The shower sprayed the whole bathroom impossible to contain without a bigger glass panel or shower curtain It is a lovely building but needs some upkeep inside ,0
 I paid for a superior room and the room was the size of a small walk in wardrobe The shower didnt have a curtain soo the floor gets completely soaked Their large towels are big enough to dry a young child It was ridiculous,0
 The room was on the small size as well as the en suite Did not see a tip box for the staff as I would have most definitely liked to have given the staff something they were absolutely wonderful which made up for the room being on the small size ,0
 Good location with easy access to Queensway underground station Although our room had been recently refurbished and comfortable it was referred to as a Club Room but was very small Friendly and helpful staff but the property could do with a major makeover ,0
 Bedroom and bathroom where on the small side but we didn t really need any more space as it was only a short stay,0
 Twin room is tiny with very little natural light No hotel parking available ,0
 The size of the bedroom Super small bathroom shower far too small No possibility to open windows for fresh air What happened in case of fire Looks obvious they have been maximising the profit by reduced rooms size ,0
 Small rooms Noisy air con units Little sleep due to noisy neighbouring buildings Room at the back of hotel overlooking the bins,0
 Do not test the fire alarms without informing arriving new guests that are jet lagged and sleeping This was extremely upsetting ,0
 Towels were small room was a bit on the tight side Provided shampoo and body wash smelled good but left odd feeling on hands ,0
 Tiny room Bathroom very small Shower size the smallest I have every been in Fridge not cold Iron and Ironing Board cheap and barely worked Complimentary water 2 x small bottles not complimentary No notification of such ,0
 Staff friendly very Clean and a walk back in time to style of the communal areas ,0
 I noticed the lack of a face cloth in the bathroom I guess this is not a British convention ,0
 To be honest I was disgusted with the hotel My friend was too big for bed ad he s 6 1 and the bathroom was a joke Tempted to ask for my money back ,0
 The shower cubicle was very slippery and no hand rail ,0
 Toilet was too close to wall almost had to sit sideways Shower cubicle was too small I m not large but it was all too close for comfort ,0
 There wasn t anything I did not like,0
 The exceptionally small bedrooms A double room can nearly fit two people and two suitcases 2 people cannot walk around the room at the same time ,0
 Bedrooms a little small,0
 Tony rooms ,0
 The toilet flush did not work properly The sink could not be reached as it was so small Cold tap could not be opened without excessive force,0
 Very but I mean very small rooms Tiny bathrooms In my room the window was stuck and not open even a little,0
 Noisy neighbours and banging doors but the staff handled the problem beautifully once I d rung through to reception and also the Manager spotted the notes when I was checking out and asked if the problem had been dealt with ,0
 Room was slightly small but given the location and ambience of the hotel was prepared to accept that as a small negative ,0
 The rooms are small but it is central London ,0
 Small rooms specially when have babystroller Had stairs in the hallway and in the room not ideal for us ,0
 Small bathroom but was enough for the stay ,0
 Poor room facilities Says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it Rooms are TINY For a 4 star to not have any room service is poor Has a fridge which was empty No guest service book had to guess how to even call reception I travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again ,0
 Double booked at Hotel and Hotel has yet to refund me me the cancelled booking Have disputed double charges with my credit card company and the issue has yet to be resolved in my favor ,0
 The first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small We relocated to room 508 which was the same size as the first ie very small We hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room Both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost Room 508 did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after I mentioned it Also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall I guess it did work ,0
 Wifi is too bad I was at room 602 club room most of the time I could not go through This is quite important for me traveling for business otherwise I have to use my local carrier which cost me a lot as it is international ,0
 It is obviously not the hotel s fault but there are major building works adjoining and opposite which could be going on for some time Some of the rooms are small and a bit claustrophobic ,0
 For a superior 4 star room it was small with a microscopic en suite Acceptable but disappointing For the price breakfast should have been included Better value breakfast was found close by Try the Italian gardens in Hyde Park ,0
 The rooms were very small just a bed and enough room to walk around it Good thing we didn t need to spend a lot of time inside our hotel rooms other than to sleep ,0
 The only down side was the room size It was certainly adequate for one person travelling light and staying for one night For two people staying two nights there was very little storage and hanging space for clothes It was clean and it was comfortable ,0
 My sister will soon be having hip surgery and getting up the steps to enter the hotel was difficult for her as there was no handicapped access ,0
 i need to cancel my last day booking due to schedule change but was rejected by booking com and hotel disappointed with the poor flexibility ,0
 Rooms very small Bathroom tiny but very clean and modern Hotel is very old and needs new carpets Wonderful wood decor but needs refinished It could be a beauty I probably would not go back ,0
 The size of the room could be greater but our criticism on this point is minor You could arrange for a common pot for tips The staff was excellent but we were told that one only pays tips to a given person for services rendered e g porter I wanted my tip to be placed for the benefit of all the staff ,0
 The room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room It was smaller than our bedroom at home The view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade I couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room The pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown The advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune I ve spent over 100 less per night in London for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities The overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost ,0
 All good,0
 1 Close from the tube station but a little bit hard to find out the location surrounding by houses 2 Window cannot be opened so hot ,0
 Rooms on floor 8 a little small but adequate ,0
 We had two rooms and we would have preferred they be on the same floor However this was a last minute reservation and it was not possible This was completely understandable ,0
 The room was a little cramped and there was no iron ironing board Apart from that amazing ,0
 I feel the breakfast should be included in the room rate its an expensive hotel to start with ,0
 We had a Superior Queen room and to say it was a tight fit for two people would be an understatement The room was so small you could not actually turn around on one side of the bed I have a bruise on my arm from whacking it a few times on the handle of the closet as it was so narrow going into the bathroom and out the door ,0
 Not sure about shower screen it wasn t big enough to stop the floor from getting wet,0
 We booked a twin room only to arrive and find out that there were no twin rooms available At the end the receptionist could find a room in a sister Hotel nearby which apparently was bigger than the one we booked Thus they wanted us to move again the next day which we refused since we had unpacked everything We booked a Club room with club Lounge Access from booking com However we found out that the Club Lounge was open to the guest only upon availibility At least one of the days the Lounge was busy all day and not on use for the guests ,0
 Tiny bath area and the bathroom could have been cleaner ,0
 The room was extremely small and for 2 persons with luggage and shopping the space was not enough ,0
 Small room for two people and bathroom very small,0
 Unfortunately the rooms were very small But to be expected in buildings built in that era Nicely updated bathrooms TV etc ,0
 The size of room and the mattress was so bad and cheap The house made was bother guest on morning Even I past do not distribute,0
 The bedroom sizes ,0
 None,0
 I found the room dated not very clean fitted furniture hanging off the wall and a smell coming from the toilet drain I can t see how this hotel is rated as four star Possibly two star and that s pushing it,0
 Room was small and Not enough wardrobe space Also stairs from room door to room itself meant difficulty negotiating round bed to get to bathroom Could easily have an accident during the night and fall ,0

 The rooms are quite small but adequate for two people Bathrooms are very small ,0

 Rooms were smaller than expected and from about 6am there was banging coming from above my room I was told this was the restaurant so I cannot recommend this hotel They did offer a 20 refund but this didn t make up for the unwanted alarm call of banging chairs ,0
 The hotel checked someone else into my room Kept me waiting while they checked their mistakes and then didn t offer or provide an upgrade by way of apology ,0
 Slight issue with the TV as could not receive all channels but staff member assisted though was unable to completely solve the problem ,0
 The room was tiny to the point that you had to step aside for the other person to move and the windows wouldn t open not even slighly to get some fresh air something totally unhealthy ,0
 I was disappointed that there was no dinner service I would have enjoyed dining in style in that lovely room ,0
 The Room was very small The shower was poor The breakfast was to expensive the channels weren t working in the tv I won t be staying in this hotle again,0
 Maybe not understanding why booking breakfast at Reception attracted a 3 discount Why make paying guests jump through a hoop Fair enough for non guest But the hotel has already collected 130 So not a customer friendly policy does the hotel need the 3 difference that much ,0
 It was located further out than we expected Had to take taxis to get to places Not a lot of restaurants to chose from And did not like the idea of our room in THE BASEMENT ,0
 Room a bit small,0
 noise from construction work across the road in the morning,0

 The room was a little on the small size and was difficult to get around the bed to get into it ,0
 Bathroom was minute my partner who is 5ft 5 struggled to fit in the shower I m 6ft 3 and couldn t move and it was a complementary upgrade I wouldn t want to see the standard accommodation bathroom ,0
 We thought the room was a bit smaller than we expected but nevertheless was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our one night stay and did not include things we didn t need or use such as posh note pads and mini fridges A trouser press for the men would have been useful after all there was a hair dryer for the ladies ,0

 Our bedroom could have been a bit bigger Sometimes it was difficult to move about ,0
 Our room was smaller than I expected one side of the double bed is along the wall so we could not comfortably open both our suitcases ,0
 The room size was ridiculously small it was actually a free upgrade so i would not want to our original 150pn room I literally have bruises from banging into things ,0
 I left a top behind rang the hotel told them what happened receptionist took all my details promised to ring back that was 3 weeks ago not good ,0
 Room overlooked bins at back but hey one nite buinsess no problem,0
 Room is not big Few light ,0
 the room is too small we booked a deluxe twin the reality was different from the photos there was hardly any room for suitcases the bed sheets were dirty such basic necessities as toiletries and toilet paper were often missing when we came back to the hotel in the evening the shower hose was too short and my height is only 1 6 m so if you are tall it ll be very uncomfortable you can hear the floors creaking and squeaking from all the rooms around and above ,0
 The rooms were very small specially for a 4 hotel the photos cheat a little ,0
 The rooms are small ,0
 As above,0
 The room is a little bit small than what I had initially thought I travelled on my own and didnt spend much time in the room so its alright However it would be a lot better if its just slightly bigger and I have a bit more floor space ,0
 The beds sagged a lot ,0
 The room was not what I expected from the booking and a hotel of this nature the manager has been directly reviewing the concerns and contacted me directly ,0
 even with a double upgrade room super small DOUBLE bed for 2 used to 2 queen or a king BUt Europe London different,0
 View from the room was of piles of rubbish bins so we were unable to open the window during the night The bathroom had a very very small shower which was not very pleasant to use ,0
 The room was a bit small so it lacked a proper place to work on the laptop But sitting in the beautiful lounge makes up for this ,0

 Bar was beautiful staff member behind it needs extra training in customer service ,0
 Not sure I can find a fault ,0
 The cleaning of the room while proper seemed a bit sloppy she must have broken a glass while cleaning because we found broken glass on the floor just once ,0
 We did not like the exit of the Queensway subway station The sizes of some rooms were very tiny ,0
 Room was a little cramped ,0
 The original room I was placed in I could touch both sides of the room the room smelt like it hadnt been aired for weeks and when changing the size of the room improved but it was still slightly run down for what you would consider a 4 star hotel ,0
 Creaky floorboards I know to be expected Thin walls small rooms At night our neighbours snored very loudly and watched FV in the hours that we should all be asleep ,0
 Had breakfast in room for 3 but sent on 2 plates and wasnt the best quality Also a room for 3 was double and pull out sofa but no bedding pillows duvet etc Provided on request though ,0

 The room was small the bed was hard and there was a split in the carpet were it had been joined together ,0
 I wish there had been space for a mini fridge The room was a tight fit for one adult and child Also I m sure it was a fluke but found evidence that the room had not been vacuumed from the guest who was there before us She must have had a lot of hair ,0
 Extremely small rooms even for London standards especially for the price Average customer service Difficult to get to from airport via public transport ,0

 The rooms are very small if your used to big American hotels this will shock you but for London it s what to be expected the bed was genuinely a bit small to be called a double though will be staying here again but will pay extra for bigger room bed ,0
 Wish we were there for longer It was over too quickly ,0
 I have booked a superior double room at Grand Royale What I have got was a two class single room in a bed and breakfast location called Shaftesbury Hyde Park International This is a bed breakfast location without any comfort the room was a single not a double room not very clean so small that I was unable to open my suitcase The heating system was off and the stuff needed two hours to put on the heating system So I have booked a superior double room at Grand Royale London Hyde Park a four stars hotel what I and another couple have got was a second standard bed breakfast two stars single room in a bed breakfast location in the same street this for a proice for a four stars hotel This is an illegal practice of the hotel which should have consequences ,0
 Window in the room didn t open Bed was much too soft The heating went on in the middle of the night we were boiling Didn t sleep at all ,0

 The room we expected was not available Alternative was small cramped and noisy with outlook over dirty buildings Described as superior deluxe not in our view ,0
 No one pointed out where the Bar area was in case wanted a drink before going out not even sure if there was one one Equally no one pointed to us where the restaurant was to see if we could be tempted to eat in So not a real negative just a missed opportunity ,0
 Room was small alright for a single person but tough to share There was a desk with a chair I could not use because it was tight against the bed ,0
 Dust behind bed on carpet ,0
 The staff wouldn t let my boss his guests vacate the hotel until they had paid for breakfast which I had arranged to settle using the corporate credit card The staff said they couldn t take payment over the phone Useless ,0
 The room was cold at the window Had to pull a curtain between the bed area and the sitting area There was no heating in that area Would not stay in this room again,0
 however I was not aware that my room would be so small and in the basement of the hotel There were no photos of such small rooms on website,0
 The size of the room and taking the 109 00 out of our account to put it back in 2 days later Staff knocking on the door at 10 15 to say you are checking out today,0
 Everything else very poor value for money The bathroom was so small that my friend and I who both have mobility problems dare not use the bath or shower in case we could not get out again We were told that we had an upgrade to a larger room how small would the other room have been Would never go there again ,0
 I am a frequent traveling and this is unfortunately the worst hotel I have ever stayed in Extremely small room One way in and one way out Floor in reception area needs lots of love Misleading based on images shown on the website Wifi was miserable,0
 We usually book a Delux or Club room at this hotel but our funds were a bit tighter for this visit so we booked a Superior Standard Room It was adequate for just going to bed in however the bathroom which only had a shower cubicle some have baths with built in baths our bathroom was ridiculously small no elbow room at all There was significant corrosion under the sink on the fittings and the wall was pitted beneath one of the switches in the bedroom area The heater was effective but very noisy and our window was rather drafty Our room was to the rear of the hotel and by 6am we could hear the faint sound of the tube station below the hotel even on the 3rd floor ,0
 Inadequate heating had to move three times shower didn t drain properly cleanliness evidence of previous occupant left on floor ,0
 the staff are welcoming and happy English needs a tad refining ,0
 Room a little warm we didn t manage to figure out the aircon but we opened the windows anyway ,0
 The room was a bit small It was really clean and all but a bit old,0
 Unfortunately there was roadworks just outside our window so we were woken up rather early Saturday morning by construction machines but once we shut the window we couldn t hear them Room was also on the small side it was more cosy as opposed to spacious and luxury ,0
 The Grand Royale had an issue with the water boiler so we were moved to the Shaftesbury Hyde Park just down the road We were upgraded and had breakfast included because of the inconvenience The staff at the SHP were very helpful ,0
 Bathroom extremely small Bedroom was small Wall where case stand was very scruffy and marked Beautiful foyer but dusty Was told I would be contacted by manager but wasn t ,0
 Room was very very small and dark with only a tiny window to a dark backyard ,0
 The bed was not comfortable and the shower was near useless as it had no power ,0
 The single room was a bit small but comfy I stayed on the 8th floor but the elevator only went to the 7th ,0
 Very small room noisy from above because of very creaky floorboards Difficult drop off but mainly because of roadworks Nearby parking costs reasonable for London No restaurant in hotel for dinner ,0
 We arrived to London at 9 00 am and we were supposed to have our room at 2 oo m Therooms were not ready and they gave us something else ,0
 The furniture in the room was a little worn The desk chair was leather but with a lot of slits and missing leather from it it just felt a little tatty I would also recommend extending the shower door protector screen out a bit further as using the shower to wash hair meant the bathroom got soaked No ironing board in the room though ,0
 Room 106 was like a broom cupboard with a staircase above it From 6am no sleep due to the noise But we were moved after an early trip to reception Thank you ,0
 We had to request a bedroom with a bathtub because most come with tiny little showers and the fridge wasn t very cold but these were both minor things ,0
 Room was on the small side but we didn t seem to notice much as we were in and out a lot and the rest of the hotel made up for it ,0
 Our room had this really bad odor in it the whole time You could barely move in there since the room is basicly to crowded with stuff But otherwise a good hotel ,0
 Club Rooms are not as big as seen in pictures Since we were out the whole day for sight seeing it didn t made much of an issue But it hard to fit in 2 big size bags ,0
 We found our bedroom a club room with complimentary wine water fruit a little on the small side the bathroom was a bit cramped too However they were both clean so we shouldn t grumble ,0
 Was charged twice for room Refund takes 3 5 days Parking cost 25 and that wasn t mentioned anywhere when booking Room was tiny didn t look like anything in the pictures ,0
 There was no iron and ironing board in the room The coasters were cheap and flimsy The room we was first given had a steep stair case on entry which wasnt appealing ,0
 Unpleasant drain smell from shower which pervaded room so had to keep window open ,0
 Very small room difficult to move around hotel not very meticulously cleaned there were stains on the bathroom floor from the previous guests spider web on the ceiling corner Very expensive for what it offers ,0
 Was unable to connect my laptop to the WiFi but it was working because I was able to connect my phone to it Also the veiw but thats understandable ,0
 Got there room didn t have not heating or hot water didn t have another room so put us in their sister hotel 10 mins away which isn t as good But still charged me same price Not happy at all,0
 The facade of the hotel was being repaired I understand that it had to be done but I would have liked to have seen it I must return ,0
 Could not get access to WiFi Room was small for price For the value breakfast should have been included Bathroom looked basic I have stayed in Travel Lodges that have better bedroom facilities,0
 Basement view after being upgraded apparently Room was a little small or compact as they advertise them ,0
 There was building work being carried out and scaffolding,0
 Rooms a little on the small side bathroom even more so In fact it was so small you had to go outside to change your mind ,0
 Be careful about road construction around as it may impact your travel time by taxi ,0
 It definitely needs renovation room sizes were really small didnt seem worth the money or star rating We were disappointed,0
 We were told after our stay that our breakfast could ve been free if we d book directly through the hotel website We paid about 22 euros a morning for breakfast for 5 mornings ,0
 Do NOT stay in room 015 Tucked away in a dingy basement with no view it was plagued by a the frequent rumbling of underground trains from 05 30 am and b a random outside light switching itself on and off at regular intervals,0
 The rooms while clean are small,0
 The most small uncomfortable bed we have ever experienced for a double room along with the small room and a bathroom that was that small my head hit the ceiling in the showers and you had to climb down the side of the toilet to close the bathroom door to get to the sink and have privacy ,0
 Lot of building works and bteakfasr quite expensive at 11 99 for a 7 year old,0
 The room was tiny looked over the back of the hotel It was really noisy early in the morning because of the Bin men The bed was very small too soft ,0
 Bedroom far too small and difficult to move around bed Shower screen too small which meant we had to use towels to wipe toilet seat and floor dry,0
 We had a up grade to bigger room was wandering how big our other room was as up grade wasn t big at all also the decor needed up dating and repainting of doors especial bathroom which need a bit of gloss on it so it could be wiped in 516 also we reserved room with one debit card and wanted to pay with another but 2 days before we arrived they took money out of account which made me over drawn and then when we checked in they wanted payment for room so we payed with another card and was told it would take 5 days to process my refund on to original card this actually take longer than a cheque clearing so they had two amounts of money for one night stay not happy about this ,0
 The hotel wants to position itself somehow in the upscale but it s not up to that and fails ending up being awkwardly in the average Where in facts its real positioning is ,0
 The view was terrible An alley with skips and rubbish It was covered by broken blinds taped to the window Fire alarm at 7 30am No one came to tell us it was false alarm or to apologise for the inconvenience Staff just took payment don t do anything else like ask how was stay etc ,0
 Tiny room Small bed Dirty toilet upon arrival Dirty walls from scraches Small menu for in room dining No slippers and bathrobes in the room they brought them after my call Old room needs renovation ,0
 The room was very small for two persons The bed very small The bathroom is not existing ,0
 The room was supposed to be a double superior but not big enough for one Too small Not easy to negotiate with stairs to the toilet The bathroom too small had negotiate round the basin to gain access to shower Too small Very uncomfortable ,0
 Could be more selection on the food menu ,0
 The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and therefor there were areas closed and sealed off there was demolition signs and danger signs all over there was scaffolding up all over the front of the hotel the room wasn t clean the bed was stained and ripped the carpets were stained and there was damp on the walls a very disappointing stay,0
 Basement corridors could do with repainting floors in reception need redoing ,0
 Nice bar but the barman wasn t very friendly ,0
 Some of the towels and sheets were not changed due to my stay There were few marks on bedding so wasn t replaced ,0
 I thought the dullness in the reception area gave a poor first impression lovely building so lets see it,0
 On arrival at 10 30 at night no room was available despite having rung and confirmed the previous day and we were sent to a tiny room in an inferior hotel This is the second time this has happened me with this hotel group This is totally unacceptable particularly with a short break when time is valuable ,0
 Y,0
 Due to restoration of the building the restaurant was not open although there is no shortage of restaurants and bars near by ,0
 Bed a bit too hard and pillows a bit too big but that is just our preference,0
 Rooms facing the back were a bit noisy probably because of the external units of the air conditioning but it was manageable Rooms are rather small but this is common for London ,0
 Rooms small and our children were placed in a room round the corridor which was away from our room we had asked for rooms close by breakfast waited 20 minutes before having to ask for coffee and tea crowded breakfast room and guest who had pre paid for breakfast were turned away,0
 Room was very small didn t look like the photos and there was construction going on during our stay which we weren t aware of ,0
 Quite cool in the reception area needs heating or an open fire to compliment the building No hot water for a shower on the evening or the following morning staff were very very good and issue with the above was resolved but put a dampener on the trip ,0
 Rooms are tiny i think you should be v clear on that Charging for a bottle of water on our second and third night is not good as it cost us one thousand euro to stay there the least i would expect is fresh water every day ,0
 The rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom And for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and I felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from Honestly I was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to London for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this I definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small Not sure if I may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a 4 poster bed which when I purchased the superior double room I expected to get and if what I got was a superior double room I would like to see how big a suite is Another point would be the view I wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however The view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better One rude female member of staff at reception See first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout London however it is here I am almost 100 sure that I booked the hotel room and I received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff I previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay 15 each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing I wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the London eye or Houses of Parliament and the Thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful ,0
 The photos are enhanced on the Internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if I m honest a bit dreary From outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of Windows It needs sensitively being freshened up throughout The decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss Bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly Perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded We had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely I wouldnt stay again ,0
 Unfortunately the hotel had boiler problems and we were move to another in their group The Grand Park Paddington 1 2 Devonshire Place Which was not where we wanted to be ,0
 The room was very very small so a couple with 2 medium suitcases is not very easy to move around in the room The breakfast is a basic typical hotel breakfast I would expect a little a bit more than that ,0
 Room was a club double but a little small The issue with the room was that the hotel had no hot water on the morning of our departure so I endured a cold shower and my daughter did not have one ,0
 club rooms slightly small especially shower toilet smaller than expected,0
 One thing we found strange is that you had to reserve the time you will go to take the breakfast from the day before or you might not find a table and will have to wait ,0
 Hotel is dated Hallways are marred and marked with luggage collisions Construction in progress on the entrance side of the building ,0
 Bedrooms very small but ok Also when renovations complete I would think the hotel will be even better ,0
 Room was tiny Designation of double superior suggests at least adequate size but it was easily the smallest we have ever stayed in Little more than 12 inches either side of the bed and not being able to open the wardrobe door is ridiculous ,0
 Had amended booking but they didn t have the amendment had to wait for reservations to confirm even though I had proof restaurant far too small had sittings for breakfast so had to book time but they still couldn t accommodate us at the time and there was no room to pass tables Walls thin could hear all toilets flushing and showers running from above below and either side ,0
 The layout of the bedroom through the door and immediately down five steps to the bed not good if ur unsteady on your feet Also the floor boards in our room and the one above squeaked quite badly ,0
 They were renovating at Xmas time scaffolding out front and fireplaces not being used and lounges pushed together We had booked many months beforehand and were not advised of this Should have been offered discount and given opportunity of going elsewhere Also toilet hard to use as it was too close to basin and shower I was very disappointed,0
 I was transferred from the original hotel I booked They couldn t provide a twin bed and I asked for a room with windows instead I was given a basement room They complementary phone didn t work ,0
 Dont go here if you like to spend time on your room go here if you sleep in the hotel and you re out the whole day ,0
 THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE HOTEL WAS A BIT NEGLECTED THE PICTURE ON THE WEB DID NOT REFLECT THE IMAGE THE STAFF TRIED TO HELP BUT SOME FEEL SHORT WHERE AS SOME WENT BEYOND SAY WHAT YOU MEAN DO AS YOU SAY ,0
 Ordered a taxi from reception and they they did not know where they were going abd had not hear of the Ritz Do not order Uber cabs for guests ,0
 The reception staff mundane lethargic not welcoming they need customer service skills they are the only thing that i found wrong with this hotel With the exception of an Asian male receptionist who smiled welcomed people ,0
 Room is rather cosy but perfect for a short stay comfortable and reasonably priced,0
 What they call a double bed could even fit 2 27 year old adults in Dent in middle of matress Fire alarm went off Both rooms we had were so cold and drafty The whole room was so small when going to the toilet you could hardly sit down The hotel it s self is lovely but the rooms are far to small and beds for what we paid I have never ever left a review but feel in this instance it is necessary ,0
 The room was not upto standard carpets stained and the walls room door would not lock radiator was not working and lose We only got told the radiator was not working till after we complained as well as the door told to put the chain on we raised our concerns health and safety as the radiator could come off to be told its acceptable thermostat not working set on one temperature Hairs all over the bed that was not mine partners I asked to change rooms which they did at no extra cost the new room was alot better but still Hairs on the bed So had to shake it off Went out for a meal and heard a conversation with another guest with the house keeper saying they had no room service that day it did not give us a good impression of the hotel Will not be going back to this hotel ,0
 I didn t like not knowing about scaffolding and non working fireplaces Also the printer was out of ink the entire time we were there and impeded our printing tickets etc ,0
 The room was very small thi s made it difficult to walk around the bed without catching your leg on the bedroom furniture,0
 There was mould around the bath The bath wasn t clean there was someone else s hair all around it,0
 They are renovating also a good thing ofcourse But the staff did everything to please us ,0
 Room Size We were upgraded to Club Room which was one of the larger room sizes This room was still very small incl the bathroom Exercise care when selecting room size ,0
 Rooms are very tight especially the front door couldn t swing open bigger and was a step down from the corridor floor some more Difficult to pull my luggage in ,0
 sink in bathroom too small and plug let the water out because it didn t fit properly Bathroom could have been a bit bigger ,0
 No need to change towels daily but no way of saying please don t Having fair trade branded tea coffee sugar in room would be a great plus for me ,0
 It was quite a small room clean and quiet but with not a lot of space Overnight it was very cold We asked for and received an extra blanket and a heater on the second night but shouldn t have needed to ask for it ,0
 The London weather ,0
 The room was tiny It was so disappointing considering I booked a superior room As soon as you opened the door there was 6 steps leading up to the room There is approx A foot and a half distance between the edge end of the bed and the steps Lots of renovations going on the front and inside the hotel ,0
 Room was small but manageable we weren t visiting to spend time in a hotel room so it wasn t much of a drawback ,0
 The room we were in was small compared to other Hotels we have stayed in Also mentioned to reception as I left fingerprint marks were on the bathroom door and the door jamb maybe needed wiping down as part of the room cleaning process ,0
 The hotel rooms are quite small They were clean but in need of decoration The entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate We didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on 2 different floors We booked these rooms over 2 months in advance We were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star it s a 3 in my opinion ,0
 Felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand Paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped I would not of paid the price we did for the room if I had seen it before hand I feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all Bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of 3 Would never use this chain of hotels again,0
 Bed was too small and the property was loud This was the only property I used a debit card in and on return to the US someone in the UK area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash Not recommended ,0
 View from room was of a wall wasn t made aware of construction of building and change of room before arrival which was disappointing,0
 Lady rang asked if we wanted room cleaned we said yes but she never cleaned that s ok we asked at reception they said she must have picked me up wrong but yes means yes at the end of the day so we said just leave clean towels for morning but they didn t arrive unhappy about that ,0
 The room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really The window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy But my main gripe is that on arriving I was told I have to provide a credit card I didn t have the same card on me as I booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount When I got home I noticed that I had been charged twice and I phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take 6 days for the money to be returned to my account It would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues ,0
 Very basic and ungenerous place without feeling Having a drink in the bar and reading newspaper Staff member dimmed lighting at 11 35 pm Really rude Towels grey instead of white Bedding low quality You just feel like a package being pushed through a system on the cheap ,0
 Shower involved high step up and over which was cumbersome for this older traveler ,0
 The room was absolutely tiny the smallest I ve ever stayed in My boyfriend is 6 3 and they put us in a room in under the eaves The night staff and staff who checked us out seemed so disinterested MTV was playing in the lobby which did not suit the decor or 4 star status We were also not informed of the renovation works being done The whole facade is covered in scaffolding and the fireplaces in the foyer are covered over with big sheets of a plastic and one is completely blocked off with sofas The building work outside woke us up at about 8 30am this may have been acceptable if we had been warned prior to our stay or even when we checked in but it was not mentioned at all and this is really good enough Our stay was not that of a four star hotel ,0
 Scaffolding outside the building due to renovations and fires in reception were not lit ,0
 we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark The rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on 2nd floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins However the rooms we moved to in the basement 003 and 004 were much more spacious ,0
 When we arrive the hotel we 3 rooms for 7 nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work Without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about 1 2 months in advance we were very disappointed It was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station ,0
 No tea or coffee replaced on our second day but that was soon rectified by the front of house staff,0
 We were first shown Room 624 which was so small It should only be listed as a single CERTAINLY not as a double But we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better So I cannot fault the service The bathrooms are fabulous best I have ever seen However the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like Very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas The bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there We came back in at around 10 30 pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area Others came in later and had to stand Unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed Which is a shame as it is a beautiful building All in all a nice stay but not a great one ,0
 Although the breakfast was lovely due to the size we were asked to state a time for which we wanted to take it This was a little difficult but it didn t affect our stay we would use the hotel again ,0
 I had the best experience ever Thank you ,0
 Small rooms Confusion at my check in could not arrange me a room due to maintenance problems Offered me to stay at a hotel nearby After 30 mins they manage to sort me a room at their hotel ,0
 The only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed So we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate The bathroom was small but had a bath The room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best They never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter The check in process was a pain We arrived at 1 30 so 30 minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready That was ok and we decided to wait in the hall No one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after 45 minutes I had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else When we finally got the key 5 minutes later we had to wait another 5 minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall Overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for London ,0
 Small room very unkept in the decorating side pealing paint and at the back of the hotel so very noisy,0
 The fact that the room we had booked was out of service and we were sent to a smaller Grand Royale hotel ,0
 Room very old wallpaper coming off wall and covered in marks carpet coming away from wall and where joined together Bed very hard and uncomfortable bathroom very small but has been updated Terrible smell coming into room through air con vent we phoned reception who said they knew about it and were trying to fix it but we never heard anything disappointing This hotel is not for us ,0
 Wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half 10 at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel On arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the TVs were shut down with no signal on the screen Totally dissapointed I made sure staff where aware on our last morning I took it upon myself when I got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my Christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since September had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing Avoid ,0
 Booked in October for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in January it was around 20 cheaper Staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less Rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom Back of bathroom door was very dirty Very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast Definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel ,0
 see above window looking out on the rough side ,0
 There was no fridge within the room we stayed in and the room was quite small Also we found the breakfast room way to small we felt we were sitting on top of each other whilst eating our breakfast temperature was far too hot ,0
 Building work under way but was not informed when we booked For food only breakfast and snacks no lunch or dinner in the restaurant Floor boards in room all loose and very noisey and shower screen to small so all water went on the floor ,0
 Initially we stayed in room 235 We couldn t sleep all night due to the extremely loud noise from the pipes It seems that there is a problem with certain rooms this noise However to credit the hotel when I complained the next morning we were moved to another room which was perfect ,0
 The room was tiny and not enough storage for 2 suitcases and clothes in wardrobe more like a single room with a bed for a double room Reception was ALWAYS busy so always a que building works affected aesthetic and breakfast room use yet but price still the same snacks limited etc in bar and served in packets not expected for star rating ,0
 The room was not cleaned properly The tables were soiled and food on the floor after the room was cleaned Not very thorough ,0
 The attitude of the staff during the check in The assumption that I wanted two single beds even though I booked a double room How the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple So called technical problem with the room I wouldn t recommend staying here ,0
 Even though Im a genius and booking com said no deposit would be taken and no prepayment was required the hotel still took out a deposit from my credit card prior to arriving ,0
 Room not very big limited space between bed and wall Small wardrobe Front of the building covered because of repair,0
 Probably the smallest double I have ever stayed in If this was a superior double I would hate to see a standard room I couldn t use the safe as there wasn t enough room to open it ,0
 We arrived at 2 15 and our room was still not ready so we waited in the bar for 40 minutes until our room was ready which delayed what we were doing that day by over an hour ,0
 Room was super small Very very loud you could hear everything outside the hotel and inside Very uncomfortable bed ,0
 When we arrived they told as that they didn t have any room available and they asked as if we wanted to stay in another hotel they had We said no we had booked this room 2 months ago At the end they found a room available in the basement with no window etc we didn t accept and then by miracle they found one available on the 6th floor The rooms are very small,0
 Rooms were too warm at times The bedding only included a duvet and no top sheet Shower was extremely small with very low water pressure ,0
 The first room the gave which it was on the 6th floor its was like a grave and not even a room it was really shocking then they moved me to the basement which it was a bit better room it was no 016 but the 1st room I didn t recall what number was it ,0
 The bathroom was tiny ,0
 The room was so small for 2 people We had to take turns putting our suitcase on the bed to get things out and hanging our coats on the one chair made it so tight getting to and from the bathroom Our room had a horrible smell of damp which was very unappealing unable to get any fresh air in the room so it was very uncomfortable ,0
 I don t see how any improvements could be made to the quality of the room cleaning services and position of the hotel I would definitely return ,0
 Really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again ,0
 Surly unhelpful staff and no room available Reception staff economical with the truth regarding reason for unavailability Frankly told lies most unhelpful Would never go near the place again,0
 The hotel was clean our room was small for a club room and it was on the lower ground so no view Had I been Informed about the scaffolding and work being done in the main dining room I would of looked for an alternative property for our stay This was disappointing as it was a special evening I booked for my wife as a surprise ,0
 Property is not quite a 4 since it needs some renovation No mini bar in the room ,0
 Rooms are rather small still one has everything he she needs ,0
 My room was tiny had to shuffle sideways around the bed the bath bathroom were tiny felt I d paid to stay in a cupboard we will NEVER go back there ,0
 No water at all when needed even to flush loo due boilerwork No offer of compensation or change of accommodation Found nibbled biscuit on floor Delux double very basic with view of scaffolding No response from hotel despite 2 emails to manager Very disappointing experience ,0
 Some rooms are tiny no room for big luggage or movement or without a window Towels could have been bigger and there are no robes or sleepers No ventilation in the bathroom and the waters were running out from the bath ,0
 The room was tiny we had an upgrade to a club room at check in as it was bigger which was very nice of them the superior double room must have been like a cupboard if this was the case Feel like 160 odd was a bit steep for a small room Shame about the scaffolding on the outside but that couldn t be helped ,0
 The double room is rather tight and there is no space for large luggage or movement in the room Rather disappointed no robes or slipper or shower cap Complimentary bottled water is given on 1st day but not on subsequent days as compared to other hotels that I have stayed ,0
 the room aren t that great the pipes makes a lot of noise during the night which didn t make us sleep really well,0
 The room was very cold the radiator did not work The TVs channels didn t work The front door did not lock A lot of the switches in the room didn t work I asked for an extra blanket calling room service twice as they forgot and they brought it an hour later ,0
 Our room was in the attic I think It was very small indeed However we didn t explore other options and it was cheap so we don t take it personally Room a little tired and should really be sold as a single ,0
 The superior double room was small There were no bedroom slippers n toothbrushes The cloak cabinet were tiny like a budget hotel There is no space for large luggages There is no fridge as compared to the twin which has a fridge Complimentary bottled water given during check in but not for subsequent days of stay ,0
 The room is extremely small and the double bed barely fit Ultra small wardrobe combined with compact space made living from large suitcases quite uncomfortable ,0
 Tiny rooms old and smelly having work done inside and on the front which wasn t aware of when booked so appearance wasn t great Didn t like the stay ,0
 Restaurant to serve meals rather than just sandwiches Ice creams were advertised as Ben and Jerrys but were a different less well known make ,0
 Upon arrival we couldn t see hotel only scaffolding very disappointing nobody told us about renovations Reception staff very helpful but overall hotel is very tired rooms not at all like pictures paint flaking duvet cover didn t fit bed net curtains dirty I would say a rating of 2 3 at most such a shame as staff were so nice ,0
 I didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk We he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets The hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us The police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally I wouldn t recommend the hotel I had saved to take my boyfriend to London ,0
 We didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the Metropolitan hotel This was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day In addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the Grand Royale The sister hotel did not meet our expectations either When we returned to the Grand Royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room All in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in London for two nights ,0
 The room was very small bed was small and bathroom was to small to get in couldn t move in there Also hairdryer wouldn t come out of drawer so couldn t dry hair well Not good value for money False advertising Expensive for what you get ,0
 The staff where so unhelpful telly broken complimentary drinks half drunk staff couldn t have cared less Very disappointed and I m not normally one to complain ,0
 Room was fairly cramped The shower screen was far too small water kept going all over the floor and the water wasn t actually on for the first few hours we were there,0
 Couldn t get a sit down breakfast in the resteraunt in the morning We had to perch on the small double in our room Single glazing and noise from the street made for an uncomfortable night Internet was intermittent the mobile phone inoperable ,0
 room was small and they gave me an upgrade ,0
 There are two truths to this property s description Yes it s in London Yes it s on Hyde Park This is where it ends The Grand Royale is no hotel It is a hoStel Whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here The room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth Spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else ,0
 They state superior double room But not kidding it s a box size The 1st room had no space on one side of bed a day was 1ft space between foot of bed and wall We requested change they did but then 2nd room smelt of damp So 3rd time lucky ,0
 Would have been nice to have a ramp for our buggy and we had to leave our buggy at reception as it would not fit but that was OK ,0
 Sold as a family hotel when clearly it is not Steps to hotel no access for disabled or pram users Dining g area only had 1 high chair which we had to wait for,0
 Not being informed of scaffolding outside and fireplaces blocked up with polythene There was even a delivery of toilet rolls heaped outside Poor impression really ,0
 The bed was too small we are used to kingsize and concequently we don t sleep too well ,0
 Lifts rated as for 6 persons which could only accommodate 2 people with luggage before the overloaded alarm sounded But as the hotel was undergoing a major facelift this may have been a factor ,0
 They had our rooms mixed up and gave our key to someone else after we d checked in Another couple walked in when we were having a nap Not great Room are tiny however I appreciate that goes with the territory in London ,0
 Quite expensive from last time we stayed brother in laws room was cheaper that our by 40 00 and we had same room and staff could not tell us why,0
 Room is a bit small you could hear people walking on the floor from the top room all the time Staff however claimed that they would look into the matter ,0
 Hotel changed from the one booked meant a much longer walk to the nearest tube station I cannot accept that it was not known earlier that work was underway at the booked site ,0
 Expensive breakfast Small room and small bathroom Our room was on the ground floor but we had to climb some stairs with our luggage and no elevator,0
 the filthy sheer curtains in my room and the tiny night stands My view was pretty bad too Also there was scaffolding on the building which couldn t be helped but destroyed the atmosphere ,0
 The bathroom was quite small ,0
 The smallest room and bed i have ever stayed in I tried to request a change but the internet was down and they d get back to me which never happened ,0
 Upgraded to a deluxe double from superior or were we as it was extremely small unable to upgrade further which was disappointing Bathroom was a tiny en suite which was a joke Stairs inside room to the bed Room was unbearably hot air conditioning didnt work Staff arguing in the bar fire alarm set off staff unsure what to do Would not recommend this hotel ,0
 Bar area was musty smelling and the Sauvignon Blanc Chilean no choice was suitable for your fish and chips Rammed into the tiny breakfast restaurant admittedly due to current hotel restorations but just not great even after having to book a time to make sure it wasn t to busy ,0
 For the price the room was a little small but it was only to sleep in so it didn t really matter ,0
 Being woken by housekeeping staff talking for ages and very loudly right outside our door even though do not disturb was on display,0
 Club Bar coffee good but such a strange room to call a bar Its an internal room with no outside light ,0
 not told restaurant was being renovated or we had to book a table for breakfast so no room for us in the morning room very small and draughty no nice lobby lounge as on website as restaurant now there got charged for breakfast even though couldnt get in ,0
 Staff failed to warn about building work and we were disturbed by banging above The fruit platter contained a mouldy plum and unripe pear ,0
 Rooms very tiny and lower ground a bit like a rabbit warren ,0
 The room is too smaller than which we see on the website Especially in the bathroom I cannot even turn around ,0
 Work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were TINY very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room There was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos The cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests The staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic They did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price ,0
 Bar could have stayed open a little later,0
 The room was of poor quality asked to be moved the did to a room that was just as poor the area where the put me up bed was damp the wallpaper stained had not been cleaned throuher it was a mess waiting for the manager to contact me with no effect had to pay for breakfast when I booked with you breakfast was included I can go on an on,0
 The first room we were giving was a basement room which was tiny and freezing as the window wasn t properly sealed which in December isn t great They did however move us to a slightly larger room which was nice and warm I thought overall it was very expensive for what it was ,0
 The value for place is absolutely ridiculous The price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received I would give this hotel 3stars minus just for the location The hotel charged mi 150 pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for I have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details,0
 Bedroom was the smallest I ve ever stayed in and apparently we were given a free upgrade to a Club Room God knows what the standard room size is like They accidentally booked someone else into our room and blocked our key card but apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine ,0
 Staff attempted to relocate due to maintenance issue but weren t prepared to pay for taxis Staff were unhelpful Waited 20 minutes for bags at departure and when asked they hadn t even given the ticket to the attendant Scaffolding outside Poor,0
 We didn t appreciate the hotel trying a bait and switch on us They tried to get us to move to their sister hotel using the same spurious maintenance excuse they ve been using all year it seems After making a loud fuss at reception a room was miraculously available for us after all ,0
 Grand Royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates Decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard We had to ask to switch rooms as the TV didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed Walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed This hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates ,0
 It was the worst experience I reached there 12 am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem They have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room They never contacted us or phoned to say anything Moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy AC which we couldn t use to heat the room so It ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed ,0
 We booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room 711 was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and I had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than Macdonalds restaurant There were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests ,0
 My reservation was double bed deluxe however room given maximum I could say single superior and when I complain to the receptions they says hotel are full And no compensation was offered ,0
 Room small and smelt like drains stained bedding yuck Room 001 right by a staff door that banged every few mins from dawn Def not worth then money ,0
 I had a sleepless night at this hotel the room 807 must have the air conditioning system outside it There was a hum of noise from this system all night the equivalent of an idling car which was impossible to sleep through I won t be staying again ,0
 The front of the property was covered in scaffolding we were not made aware of this We were in the basement although nice rooms no view or phone signal ,0
 Renovation works in parts of the hotel were perhaps an eyesore but this didn t stop us enjoying our stay ,0
 The room was small but the character of the hotel made up for it in a large modern hotel you could wake up anywhere in the world and it would look the same not here you are in London ,0
 The building was a under construction arrived to find hotel covered in scaffolding staff then lied and said it weren t there s even though it was blatantly surrounding their building ,0
 Single rooms too many stairs items towel holders safes mirrors when foggy too high 5 6 people Wardrobe unstable no headboard 1 4 loo roll need sliding door to ensuite not enough space dangerous at night,0
 Breakfast not being included within the fee shown st the time of booking ,0
 Rooms were a little small and the bathroom could have done with a bit of a clean ,0
 The room was tiny extremely small and not well laid out at all There was no fridge for us to keep anything in and we only had water on the first night Not worth 411 for 3 nights at all and definitely not 4 ,0
 I ordered a bottle of Prosecco for my arrival we were delayed a check in by 15 minutes whilst this was organised then when I got to my room there was no bottle I had to call reception and wait 10 more minutes The pictures online make the rooms look MUCH bigger than they are to the point of being unbelievable ,0
 The room was a little cold responsive heating but had to get out of bed to switch on Room 215 window blinds did not move so could not see outside felt like in room without a window altho view was not good from the room nets or voile would have been better with working blind ,0
 the room was a little to small but we manged fine,0
 The fact we got separated as a family we booked 2 double rooms and a triple room so we could all be together but rooms were split across 3 levels and a mother and 2 kids meant for the family room had to be split up due to maintenance in the family room that nobody notified us about so caused some upset for the kids could of been a bit more efficient as waited at least an hour of our time to sort this out overall,0
 I didn t like being asked to move hotels as they had a boiler problem I was also disappointed that the large lounge area with open fire which I had enjoyed on a previous stay was closed off and we couldn t use it ,0
 I read the reviews about how small the rooms are but did not believe how TINY it is until I saw it You literally cannot have 2 people walking around at the same time The staff are not fully informed about London and transport which was unhelpful for me as a tourist ,0
 The bedroom and ensuite were very small but well modernised Renovation work was progressing so the main dining room was out of action making the smaller breakfast room very crowded ,0
 My room was cancelled They offered me to move to another hotel i didn t agree so one night we spent in a small room in basemen The next day we moved on the first floor in a standard room ,0
 as i booked online well in advance the cost of the room was held on my debit card i paid by credit card but am still waiting for the amount stopped on my debit card to be unblocked iwas told it would be credit straight away dont think this should happen as i am not rich and need every penny so i am without funds at this time because of this,0
 There were building works on the outside of the building which we were not told about and found this very disappointing however having said that they did not affect our stay at all ,0
 Room service was only sandwiches although plenty of places to eat nearby,0
 bathroom was TINY shower was the size of a small phone booth you could barely turn around The room was so small there wasn t room for a chair for the small desk ,0
 Unlike every other hotel I have ever had to book for colleagues this one refused to take payment in advance over the phone which put me in an awful position they should say they don t take payment other than face to face on the website Awful customer service I was waiting on the phone for 40 minutes and then instead of even trying to help they said just come in ,0
 The building is under construction the rooms are small old a bit dirty Very than the pictures and various prices in different websites,0
 The first room I was given was 801 which is right at the top of the building in what feels like the attic and the water heater in was bubbling all night and I could not sleep ,0
 It wasn t the hotel I oringinally booked we were moved to this hotel Then I find out there wasn t enough beds so they wanted to move me a third time again but i refused They had a pullout bed which was only big enough for a child wasn t happy especially being there 1 nite stay and had excursions booked in ,0
 At arrival I was assigned to a room that looked more as a closet or pantry than a guest room It had a step right at the entrace and it was so small that two persons were not able to stand around the room at the same time Then we asked for a room change then we were transferred to a larger room not big with a bed barely capable to fit a couple of a standard size The lobby is depressing it seems to be from the Queen Victoria era ,0
 We got upgraded to a Club Room Lord knows what standard is like Room 222 almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like Room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars Bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave Bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value Bar closed at 11 and breakfast was a whopping 15 each we didn t have it ,0
 I had a Superior room which was probably a single in a past life very small Not great value for 168 per night Bar service was very slow as the barman kept disappearing ,0
 The room was a little small but that is to be expected in inner London To compensate we were within 1 minute walk to Hyde Park ,0
 Rooms small difficult to actually sit down at the desk air con didn t work properly ,0
 The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in and very small for a double Good job only 5ft 4 The bathroom was very small The shower was adequate but you could not turn in it ,0
 overall appearance of the hotel requires a little attention love the original character shame its not used to a better advantage Bedding very poor and room very small even in the Club rooms Decor bland and dated ,0
 The room size was small and the bathroom was extra small but we made it work out OK ,0
 The bed linen wasn t changed we were there for 2 nights also want that happy that on our little balcony we had a sex toy ,0
 The rooms themselves were far below average Extremely small with almost no room to move ,0
 Decor and condition of rooms dated and tired Very small room but I guess it is London ,0
 Arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding Queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels Never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs Had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready OK so they had a problem Won t hold that against them Asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and I had upgraded to a so called club room Taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together Asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny Frankly if I hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre I would have found somewhere else The bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard The room was VERY small and there was no natural light Windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area We were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but I don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller Just labelling the door Club Room is meaningless My basic beef is that I paid extra for what I considered was a very basic room Didn t have breakfast there After checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could I gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied Sadly would not stay again Booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience ,0
 Bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window It was also very uncomfortable Everything was small shower area towels etc On arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel ,0
 Rooms were very small and the noise from outside was clearly heard What sounded like fireworks at midnight a police car at 3am ,0
 A huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration I booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with British charm and character What I discovered when I arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room This was not disclosed when I booked and I wouldn t have reserved if I had known in advance They requested full payment on my credit card when I checked in and I regret agreeing to that as I should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere So if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed ,0
 As an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways,0
 The staff in the kitchen lost it at one stage waiting for a time for coffee and taost,0
 Avoid G Floor I was in room 023 and got terribly disturbed by the smell of the food I guess it was from either the breakfast room or the kitchen Not good for resting ,0
 Small room couldn t open the window shower is small and when you take a shower it floods the entire bathroom no bed side lamp so either you re in extreme light or darkness bed is small there are cracks on the walls and they re falling apart Oh yes and no coat hangers,0
 We couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse The bed linen was stinked Rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it The four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by UK standards I will give it two stars ,0
 Our room did have a window but we were not able to open it no daylight and blin glass Very small room and very small bed considering that 2 people should slep in there ,0
 The room was absolutely tiny Never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost 500 Euro is awful First night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small Couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed Awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger,0
 scaffolding outside the whole building I paid for a surprise visit for my father and was shocked to see the exterior without even being told Booked a twin deluxe room wasn t even suitable for a deluxe single room bathroom couldn t move bath toilet washbasin all squashed into a tiny room when the door opened it hit the bed Couldnt even sit at dressing table to dry hair Had to go to reception to ask for more coffee and milk sachets really poor Going to book breakfast but room was being refurbished although another area available The Hotel had a bit of history but sadly my visit will remain history it was really poor,0
 See above,0
 Bed was too soft,0
 Price is bit high for the size of the room per say BUT considering its located in only 10 minutes from Oxford Street and its right next to Hyde park its quite nice pricing They should have resupplied water on the second day as well No fridge available in the room No slippers provided Breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs Breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical English style and it is rather subjective matter ,0
 Tried to have a bath one of the evenings I m pregnant and would have loved a hot bath after a long day but no hot water pretty disappointing ,0
 The room while clean and updated was very small I know that is not unusual in London but we were disappointed at that price point It was difficult to get out of the bed on one side as it was almost to the wall and no room for luggage to be left out and open That s really our only complaint Hotel has an interesting history and was fine for our needs ,0
 The stairs the poky room with more steps immediately inside to the sleeping area making entry with bags very difficult Small bathroom and lack of ventilation and a rock hard bed ,0
 Big queues so took a long time to check in Room was on the sub level so couldn t get a phone signal ,0
 Rooms are tiny with little space to move or place luggage Bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen ,0
 Hotel has a number of sister sites nearby they tried to get me to move to a cheaper hotel because there was an issue When I said I reserved the right to come back and cancel without penalty if I did not like the new one They remarkably found a room for me in the original hotel ,0
 The location was not 1 2miles from the venue I was attending There was scaffolding covering the front entrance The road was shared with several hostel type buildings They let a colleague check into my room without ID and no reference to her name on my booking good job she wasn t a stalker ,0
 Some interesting characters at the adjacent hotels and apartments hanging outside in the evening Perhaps that s our fault for being outdoors after dark ,0
 we stayed when renovation work going on so shrouded in scaffold shame because it s a wonderful building Drawing room as in brochure being used as dining room so sitting area is in the entrance hall or bar ,0
 The twin room we shared was extremely small Would have been suitable for single room There was no way the room temperature could be controlled in the evening when the central heating was turned on The staff provided a fan to cool the room until morning when the room air con was activated,0
 Can t think of anything to complain about ,0
 Disabled access really needs improving ,0
 The building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings The rooms slightly too small,0
 I had booked online and was informed I could pay at the property The hotel debited my account on the Friday prior to my stay on the Sunday which I wasn t overly concerned with as I had no plans to cancel On checking in they asked for the balance of the room I explained that the money had already been debited from account and I was told that it was just to hold the room and I would need to pay again So in theory I have paid twice for the room I have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within 7 days But this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again ,0
 6 stairs straighr down into the room from the door If you have stair issues be sure to mention this when you book ,0
 Rooms are very old fashioned and small Bathroom is small too with an old and not a particularly practical layout i e glass shower screen was too small and as a result the floor was covered in water after using the shower ,0
 We got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening The bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed The power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices I think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience,0
 The account of my colleague who reported that there was a rat in one of the rooms The lift didn t work properly There was building work going on everywhere The place was dusty ,0
 The rooms could have been bigger The first room I was offered was very small more like a storage room insulting and really disappointing,0
 Fridge and air con didn t work We only realised as we were leaving so it s possibly fixed now No good coffee shops close,0
 The room is extremly small and i found insects in the room and the reception ,0
 Room was way too hot and couldn t adjust temperature because window fused shut ,0
 Rooms were really small which was fine for one person but I would find sharing a deluxe with another person really difficult There s no restaurant for dinner and after getting off a long haul flight it would have been nice to sit inside the hotel instead of wondering queensway ,0
 They claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking They said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called Grand Royale and equally good but sent us off to Shaftesbury Hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night The second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room That hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast After much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the Grand Royale It appears that the Grand Royale London Hyde Park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel In my opinion they are confidence tricksters One guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason The hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms Since I was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night They killed the joy and ruined our holiday ,0
 The hotel was having building work which was not advertised there wasn t noise but it wasn t as beautiful as expected due to the works The rooms were also very small,0
 We were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at 6am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and I told them but never cleaned it The bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off ,0
 Room very small Hotel overcharged significantly on sterling exchange rate and booking site kept giving diffetent excuses but never solved it ,0
 The rooms are smaler then photos but is a National Trust Old Building so it s worth it,0
 My requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room I booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel Did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again Definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom ,0
 Staff disorganised Trainee on front desk who was unsupported and unable to check us in Rooms very small and some basement level smelt of stale cigarette smoke ,0
 Pricey for what you get and bathroom could get cramped at times couldn t have a shower without flooding the room,0
 The door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe The bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only 25cm away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving 16cm up the side of the bed We had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this I refused to pay any extra as I couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms ,0
 Bed was very uncomfortable fridge didnt get cold Wasn t really worth the money spent Would stay somewhere else next time ,0
 The staff was RUDE The air blew cool the first night but warm the second night The temperature outside was not low enough for heat When my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit I didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money I paid The staff needs more training Don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place,0
 Bed was small I m 6 2 but was given what we think is the smallest room Room in basement with no view and a noisy aircon outside ,0
 The room was very tiny I had to put my luggage on the bed to get my clothes The heater was not working ,0
 Liked everything ,0
 We waited 35 minutes to start the checking in process while the two out of their depth receptionists struggled with a handful of guests Despite the fact that we arrived late in the afternoon owing to a broken down train our room wasn t ready The guests lounge seemed to be permanently closed The employment of a concierge would have improved matters greatly ,0
 Was building works and scaffolding one floor below us We really should have been informed when booking or checking in especially as the workmen started at 7 30 ,0
 the room was super small and the bed was not comfortable the manager was nice enough to give us an upgrade to a bigger room but even that was too small to fit 2 adults and a one year old,0
 Room service menu doesn t offer much and luggage took forever to be located after I had stored it on check out since I had an evening flight Otherwise a great hotel more like home because of the warm reception ,0
 When we arrive after a long day we were told that I had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room We informed we would have to pay for both rooms until I spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms But got sorted in the end Also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads ,0
 The room was ridiculously small considering it was advertised as a superior double I couldn t find and information on what the hotel offered A tad run down and dirty The area a bit gritty but close to a tube station ,0
 book the club room which didn t feel like one The first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held 2 separate rooms The room was not well furnished despite the price paid One side of the mattress has collapsed I called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long 15mins before I could address the change of my room I was told that it was the last room and I can t make any changes I was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap When I came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night Thank god for the curtains The room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint I was too tired and upset to even request for another room change ,0
 Rooms are really quite small which is OK for a couple of days but if you are staying for an extensive period it can be an issue ,0
 As previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for London this is probably typical Upgrading to a Club room provides access to the Club Lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station Breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price ,0
 Rooms are small A bit of construction going on ,0
 bathroom size,0
 I had late check out and the staff came to the room asking to go out because was late And I dont know why start the fire alarm and only in my floor the rest of the hotel was without fire alarm,0
 The breakfast was pretty good I wish the eggs were cooked a little longer It seems people in UK like their eggs runny Due to construction we were moved to sister property so we missed out on the character of the older property,0
 The room they gave me 104 very small and have 5 stairs between the bathroom and the bed It should not be used and kept as storage They changed the room the second dayafter I told them I will leave ,0
 Hotel is under repair our room was in the lower ground floor with no natural light and was noisy The 2 nd room booked for our friends was rather small but being on 7th floor they could see out of the window ,0
 Our room and bathroom and also the bed was very small for two people Not even place to put the cloths or luggage When you entered into the room you had to be very careful not to fell down the stairs as the room was on a lower level than the corridor Not very convenient When you opened the window you had depending where the wind came from probably food smell from all the restaurants around ,0
 The bed is a bit hard ,0
 Size of the room was a bit small though for such location and money it s not a big deal,0
 The size of the room was very small and I was in a Club Suite ,0
 Superior label for the room is a joke It was small with a standard size bed Not a superior bathroom either The steps up to the main part of the room from the entrance came a a suprise ,0
 The room was very small with narrow stairs inside the room door leading up to the bed The floor was creaky and the walls were thin leading to noise from other rooms ,0
 Scaffolding around the building typically The room was perfect for a singel traveller but would have been small for two exec double room wifi unstable and signal weak in room wish for more coffee in the room and a minibar No minibar in room ,0
 The rooms were incredibly small which was challenging for us travelling with a lot of luggage We were offered a club room but the extra space was minimal and the bathroom even smaller than in the standard ,0
 The smaller room is too small The exterior view is not great,0
 Split level room with bathroom downstairs ,0
 Room Size I expect a Superior Double to be superior to something Not to be told that is the standard size in what I can only describe as a box room ,0
 Room was smaller than depicted No room for a chair just a small stool for suitcase Very tiny bathroom No space for an ironing board Room meant for a double but only suitable for one person ,0
 Superior double room was tiny difficult to get in and out of the room steps down with a suitcase Also no room to walk around the bed Bathroom also tiny Bath with no screen so when showering the entire bathroom was a big puddle The two lifts are small and one was out of action so the working one was very busy We had a train to catch so gave up waiting and struggled with our suitcase down the stairs ,0
 On arrival we were able to leave our bag and told our room would be available from 2pm Great we thought that all fits with our plans However this relaxed feeling was short lived When we returned to check in later that day we were met with a long queue that took 40 minutes to process before we made it to the front Only to be told the hotel was fully booked How we wondered could this be we d booked 2 3 months prior to our check in date and received confirmation our reservation had been confirmed We were informed that our booking would be honoured at a neighbouring hotel and a free taxi transfer would be arranged for us within 5 minutes 30 minutes later our taxi had not arrived and we noticed ours wasn t the only one that hadn t turned up So far we had been well over an hour A further 20 minutes later a taxi finally arrived and we were taken to a hotel only a few minutes away Needless to say the other hotel dealt with us promptly on arrival but all the drama at check could if been avoided if only we had been told upfront ,0
 I didn t have an opportunity to sample this hotel as they had a mix up as they put it and sent us to another hotel The staff there were rude as they spoke in a foreign language whilst resolving the issue so I didn t know what was going on,0
 The bathroom was fairly compact although useable The view from our window was of the windows of another part of the hotel but you can t have everything ,0
 The room was very small when I booked the room it was a deluxe single room but actually I could not move inside it ,0
 On arrival we were Met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work They said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in 10 mins An hour and half later we were still waiting I asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in They agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small Tv didn t have a remote to operate it either It definatley was not a four star room or experience We had to que 30 mins to get into the breakfast room When we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt They clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times Worst hotel experience for us for a long time Shame as we were there for my wife s birthday ,0
 The breakfast was too busy and we had to sit separately subsequently you were asking for coffee and items that were running out on the buffet ,0
 Room exceptionally small and could be construed as dangerous Room was in a very confined space with 10 steep steps down to a miniscule bathroom with only just enough to squeeze in and I am of reasonably small build ,0
 The pictures of the hotel rooms bore little resemblance to the actual room in particular the size of the room they were exceptionally small to the point of being claustrophobic ,0
 There were problems on arrival with our rooms we were asked if we could move hotels we selected the location to walk into Hyde Park the next day then the rooms were confirmed but only one out of the two rooms was made available by 6pm ,0
 we missed out on High Tea on our last day we left it too late the night before but it was booked out by then so book it early ,0
 Rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room On asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid I would expect to pay in a YHA but not in a hotel of this standard Ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have I had to pay in advance ,0
 We were phoned during the day of our arrival to be told that they had room issues and we were being moved to another hotel After explaining we had a car in a nearby car park and that we had all been enjoying the festival we were at in Hyde Park so could not drive we were told there would be rooms in the grand royal When we did check in we were asked to pay for the room despite the fact the hotel had already pre authorised the full amount which had already been deducted from my card This meant that I was now 600 down for a 300 bill Next came the rooms having booked a deluxe double room we were given a twin club room which was so small that two people moving around the room were constantly having to get on the bed or go into the bathroom to let the other past All through this staff were not very helpful and seemed to be basically clueless Having listened to other people checking in and out and all the other complaints at reception I can safely say I do not believe anyone had a good stay this weekend Very disappointing for a such a wonderful building in the main ,0
 The rooms were a bit small ,0
 Only issue we has was on check in We didn t have the credit card that we used to make the booking as the card had been cancelled Make sure you take the credit card that you use to make the booking This was sorted but frustrating Bed in our room had broken springs but this was quickly resolved and we were given a new room straight away ,0
 We booked a superior double room which on the whole was fine however if we had been staying for more than 2 days it would have been very difficult to store suitcases ect as room was a tad on the small side,0
 Trade off is the room is a bit cramped and the design leans to efficiency rather than comfort The finishes are starting to feel their age in the rooms themselves ,0
 When I arrived after 2 days of travelling I was told that my room would only be ready in 24 hours and that I should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale The rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards Rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower Front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had in London ,0
 Very noisy area and noisy hotel Very small double rooms staff unable to help or call back regarding complaints no door man and no help with luggage upon arrival The room wasn t cleaned as well as expected ,0
 The bedroom was of reasonable size and bed comfortable but the shower was minuscule and the toilet difficult to access a larger person might have found it impossible to use There are steps at the front of the building and to some of the public areas handrails absent ,0
 The only thing I could think of was that its a bit pricy for what it was We booked this hotel because it was on offer through booking com at 53 off usual price otherwise we wouldnt have been able to afford it ,0
 The room was so small and dark it was unpleasant The shower was soooo small you couldn t move and I am not fat The worst hotel room we ve ever stayed ,0
 Poor single glazed sash windows let in draughts I would definitely avoid during cold weather and noise The neighbours on the opposite side of the street decided to party outdoors until 00 30 we could hear everything clearly from the 7th floor with the window closed Narrow corridors Difficult with pushchair due to steps doors although staff will help if asked Many steps including at the entrance in the corridors and even in the bedroom Expensive breakfast so many good cafes in 3 10 min walking distance ,0
 Mattress uncomfortable like it was old I could hear the tube till late view from Window was a concrete courtyard room very small and no parking even though booking com said there was Shower drenched the bathroom ,0
 room could have been bigger the bed was a little hard for my taste although it seemed good quality the 8th floor is not directly accessible by lift you have to go to the 7th and then up a couple of flights of stairs no minibar or fridge we stayed in a deluxe room ,0
 Unfortunately I saw the mattress when the cleaners were changing the room and there was a large blood stain on it put me off a little ,0
 A little faster check in ,0
 The bathroom was like a coffin and not a clean one at that The entrance of the hotel was lovely but the rest was awful you could have been in a Travel lodge and saved some pennies Very noisy at the front of the hotel ,0
 As the no disturbe ight was on at the room door they STILL called me in the middle of the morning to offer room cleaning EVERY MONDAY MORNING or so they said the hotel has a FIRE DRILL Advanced warning could have been great so guests are not scared to death when it happens and nobody answers the phone at the reception ,0
 Room was modern but very small for 2 people 2 lrg suitcase only 1 would fit lying down There was no lift very narrow staircase no porter also no fridge ,0
 Room could have been a bit bigger but it was enough for us for a short break,0
 Some of the staff is not fluent in English but they do try to be professional ,0
 The bedrooms are very small and the staff are too courteous LoL ,0
 Service on arrival felt that the staff member on reception was rude we arrived after 2pm and the room wasn t ready so we has to wait ,0
 Long narrow maze of hallways and repeating corners to access rooms ,0
 Booking through booking com did not give a breakfast option at 15 pounds per person times three people times three days this was quite significant booking directley through the hotel would have had breakfast included at the same rate,0
 Clean an tidy but rooms walls are dirty and scratched room were small check in was late and hotel stuff didn t feel brothered about it so at end of oure trip I m not happy about place were I stayed in But location is really good ,0
 I did not like being at the front of the hotel We stayed for a few days at the back of the hotel and returned from a trip to be put at the front Nicer view but no sleep as you can really hear the drunks shouting in the street,0
 The fruit bowl was limited There was only an orange banana and an apple ,0
 A tiny noisy room VERY deceptively photographed ,0
 Size of the rooms is small and I don t think management can now do anything about it ,0
 I didn t like the fact that the sink and bath wouldn t drain properly and would fill up and you would have to wait half an hour for the sink to drain ,0
 The room was a bit small the bathtub did not have a door or shower curtain so the whole bathroom got all wet from a shower also no fan in the bathroom the wifi was fine but not the greatest the USB port the room came with did not even work,0
 Big room Big bathroom,0
 We were given the broken boiler story too and they tried to move us to another hotel until I asked for the price difference to be refunded we paid 158 and the sister hotel was advertised at 107 we were suddenly found an available room at the current hotel Also the room smelt of drains sewage,0
 Tiny bathroom to be honest not suitable for the price of offer also very odd window blinds in our room meant there was never any daylight which i didn t like,0
 The presentation of the hotel is quite dark and dower the family rooms leave a lot to be desired saying it is small is a little bit of an understatement and also the room was very tired and needs total redecoration ,0
 I was sorry to leave but God willing I ll be able to swing by The Grand Royale before I leave ,0
 It took them almost half a hour to check me in and in that time 3 people complained who were not in front of me but were still served first I was ignored until I complained,0
 The room was very small There was hardly any room to stand between the bed and the window For the price we paid I would have expected breakfast to be included ,0
 Checking out ,0
 The bathroom was too small I m small and struggled but my 6 2 partner found it far too cramped The staff gave an arriving guest the wrong key our room number so we had someone opening our door in the morning when when we were getting ready and didn t really appreciate that ,0
 The shower screen in our room was not big enough had to point the shower head at the bathroom wall and be careful moving so that water did not splash off me STill ended up with a pool of water on the floor and the toilet Had a bath the next day to avoid the hassle ,0
 We ll typical of London hotels Small rooms though it s a 4 star Bathroom dilemma no shower curtain the glass division was soo small thats why when u take a shower the whole bathroom is wet There s a smell stink but tolerable this matter was brought to the attention of the management They offer us to transfer to other room we we re at the basement then ,0
 When we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels 15 minutes away The boiler had broken in the hotel They did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem They also had us sign a paper committing us to full 4 night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move We were then transported at 11 p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full 4 night stay without inspection of the room or area At that hour we had no choice but to make the payment We were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a 20 minute rail ride away We asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request We called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels We then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location Around 1 p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel Although I was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the 2nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an 11 year old child the room was tiny Much much smaller than most small European rooms Worse yet it was filthy dirty The carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled The courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside We have pictures to support this description It was shocking that we were not released from the reservation We have used booking com in the past but NEVER AGAIN They should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment ,0
 No comment ,0
 Rooms are little small ,0
 We arrived after a long journey only to be told they were going to transfer us to one of their sister hotels in Paddington When we objected they miraculously found a room for us ,0
 We were in a lower ground floor room with a window looking out to steps that go up to street level which was fine but the steps area had some building materials pallets etc lying there which could have been moved out of view Shower was a bit small but fine to use ,0
 Not happy with bookings com my reservation was excepted got to hotel and we had to stay somewhere else didn t have a choice in the matter as we had already travelled to London so there was no going back This wasn t the hotels fault ,0
 Rooms were very small and they only service the room for your arrival then after your departure Though in saying this i actually asked them to service it while we were out and they did Only other negative wos that they gave us keys to a room already occupied so we walked in on another couple ,0
 The bathroom coiuld have been cleaned a little better each day ,0
 Room was like a box literally no windows couldn t swing a kitten Very claustrophobic would not consider staying here again ,0
 The area isn t as nice as the hotel but beyond the hotels control,0
 Bathroom was VERY tiny Not even a proper sink No breakfast included ,0
 They overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink I saw this because I dropped a soap The shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean I would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel I ve ever stayed at ,0
 Not all single rooms have a bathtub showers in some singles are very small by US standards normal for UK though ,0
 The bathroom was clean The 4 shower screen not a joke was hilarious and pointless and meant your shower contributed to a flooded floor each morning ,0
 Room was very small Also we would have loved to have dined in the restaurant but it is only open fur breakfast This is a real shame as I m sure it would be a lovely place to eat ,0
 I couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road The entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out After a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall Absolutely disgusted at our treatment ,0
 We were moved hotels due to an electrical fault I understand this was out of the hotels control but the alternative accommodation was not in such a good location I d been looking forward to a drink in the grand looking reception area and a short walk to Hyde park ,0
 The room was not very clean and was extremely hot couldn t open a window We were upgraded but it was a tiny room with a small bed There were cracks in the tiles it was in desperate need of a refurbishment,0
 A very small room but it was clean ,0
 Room very tight to work around the bed and bathroom tight Was expecting an iron in the room ,0
 Basement room disappointing not represented in the advertised pictures ,0
 Difficult to move around the room as the area around the bed was a bit tight ,0
 The new hotel was in an area where we did not want to be The hotel was fine apart from its location ,0
 No TV remote in room Single room so tiny Maybe I am naive but I still think 100 is a lot for a single basement room with no breakfast ,0
 Very small room eapecially as it was a club deluxe Very small bathroom could hardly move and staff customer service was not particularly friendly The reception area looked tired ,0
 The room size and access wasn t the best small with steep steps but it didn t detract from the positives I would still stay again,0
 Fortunately we are not big people other wise the bedroom would have been hopeless about 12incs around either side so my husband just managed it The receptionist suggested we mention this in future ,0
 To be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish We arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty My husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving We had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow I am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary ,0
 Room and en suite were very small for two adults I lay on the bed with the suitcase to give floor space to my wife Standing in a bath on a non slip mat to shower is not acceptable nowadays Booking com not the hotel website lists parking beware this hotel does not have parking however I was directed by reception to a nearby underground carpark ,0
 Room was smaller than appeared in pictures and there were steps inside the room entry way which are a tripping hazard Interior of hotel is beautiful but worn in places ,0
 Room was very small and cramped although en suite was adequate Housekeeping staff slam doors constantly during the afternoon ,0
 The single room although they said they had upgraded it to their largest single for my birthday was still but rather small and claustrophobic very hot You would not want to linger too long in that confined space,0
 There was a slightly bad smell in the second room We didn t say anything as we were not in the room very much and were so glad to have the bigger room ,0
 Incredibly small room So much so that we were a a couple with two medium size suitcases between us and it was too tight to have both on a stand each and the two of us bending over repacking without bumping into one another Can t swing a cat Or pack a suitcase,0
 the lock on room door was broken window latch broken,0
 Very very small rooms A bit like sleeping in a cupboard It was all very comfy but very cramped ,0
 Asked for upgrade twin club got a double and at 11 pm had to try to split the twins and reset the room it was in the basement they offered to move us but after unpacking it was too much of a hassle they did give an apology note water and fruit in our room the next day,0
 Needs a smartening up of its appearance But then it s in Bayswater not Mayfair ,0
 Pillow and bed too hard and room too confined especially bathroom However upon request they gave me a soft pillow Nice if sports had been shown on TV but available at nearby pubs,0
 Small room with a small bed But slept well with extra comforter ,0
 Slightly small bedroom but I guess that is London ,0
 Rooms average size but had all facilities ,0
 Price is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for which is a fantastic hotel ,0
 Despite paying for an upgrade the room was extremely small There was only a narrow staircase leading to the first floor and corridors leading to the room were a tight squeeze ,0
 Rooms a bit cramped no fridge marked walls furniture in the room interfering works yard below the window,0
 Our room was tiny i found some difficulties moving around inside the room but I guess it was the value for money condition ,0
 There was some issue at the hotel and on our first night we had to sleep in a partner hotel of theirs Though the quality was good the atmosphere of the room and breakfast area were not on par and we did not enjoy it that much We did return to our original hotel for the second night and were happier there ,0
 I tried to ask the reception staff for restaurant recommendations in London which they seemed to know little about ,0
 They stuck us in the basement For 1 444 for 5 nights they could not give us at least first floor The wifi did not work in the basement very well so for a week I could not comfortably contact friends and family in the states after a long day The desk people were very snooty and the tickets they booked for shows and attractions we could have bought cheaper anywhere else Do not book anything with them or believe their advice on anything I had to figure everything out on my own very hard to do with no wifi They advertised an airport shuttle but no they do not have one false advertising Cost 45 00 pounds to get to the airport All they offer is a bed a bathroom and a pretty lobby The women at the desk seemed to not have a clue about anything in their city and seemed quite content to just stand there and give bad advice Maybe if you looked like their next suger daddy they would fawn all over you but if you are a woman from the USA Forgetaboutit ,0
 I was extremely annoyed that the bill did NOT add up yo the number of days times the rate displayed by booking com The rate changes as the week progresses WARNING,0
 The room was supposed to be a Superior Double room it wasn t at all The window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so Little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned You could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed For this price not including breakfast the Hotel was very unsatisfactory A terrible cheek I would definitely want some money back I would never go to this Hotel again they are cheats ,0
 Sunday morning breakfast manic busy Staff were great but other guests who could see people waiting just sat and enjoyed their 3rd helping of food guys it s not an all you can eat Other rude quests who think they are too important to queue at check out desk,0
 There were steps in our room right after you enter it Do request for another room if this is of inconvenience to you Otherwise this is a great hotel to stay ,0
 Standard rooms are so small that two people need to carefully choreograph their moves to get dressed or go to the restroom ,0
 Tge roome size is very small The bathroom high is short for me at least ,0
 Room was very small We were placed on the Lower ground floor No views Could have told us a poor way to end a 3 week European vacation Picturing on the web very deceiving ,0
 ordered and Paid for a large wine and was given a small one bar busy could have been an error and didn t was to cause a scene,0
 The room was small but so comfortable and nice Beautiful place ,0
 I didn t like that I got a flower delivery that was never delivered to my room and that when my friend called to inquire no staff member thought to check delivery room flowers were found after I went home money lost for my friend who sent them,0
 I stayed 2 nights all was fine Left to go to Peaks region When returned was notified my 2 night reservation was cancelled Was told by staff my credit card was rejected It was same card that was used 2 nights for earlier stay Had a hassle getting rebooked at different hotel Found out later from another guest that hotel had water leak and needed to move customers to different hotel Did not appreciate being told my credit card was the problem when clearly it was not ,0
 The room was too small and the linen had several pubic hairs stuck to the sheets which made feel very sick I am not sure if the sheets had been changed from the previous guest ,0
 The fact they took the money from my bank account several days prior to our arrival Especially when it was said we can pay at the hotel upon arrival And then having to wait days for any refunds to be put back into our bank account ,0
 For the price of 168 for one night to be told that this did not include breakfast was shocking although when I complained the manager did allow us to have breakfast Also the photos of a Superior double room on the website did not live up to the reality of a very small drab room where there was barely enough room to walk around the bed There is more room and comfort in a budget hotel than this and as it was a birthday treat for my daughter we were very disappointed We won t ever come here again and it was not worth the money I will go with the budget option next time ,0
 Sent to Park Grand Paddington Hotel Room was very small No cupboard space No fridge No iron Bed made in the am but bathroom not cleaned or towels changed No mini bar Very very disappointed Not given a discount considering we paid almost double to stay at the Grand Royale Hype Park compared to the hotel we were sent too for 2 nights ,0
 Be careful when booking the total I paid by far exceeded the sum of the days times booking com s price it went up and up each day quite unfair to a trusting soul who did not add up my own bill before clicking Warning to others ,0
 Room very small and we had to wait almost an hour for sandwiches when we ordered room service the manager did say sorry for this in the morning to be fair but no good to us as we were very hungry the night before we also went to the bar for a night cap and they had no bailys cream so we went to our room very disappointed ,0
 Chaos at check in room not ready got back bag had not been taken to room no to remote room so small even I was off edge of bed im only just over 5ft Couldn t move air conditioning didn t work this was meant to be a delux double,0
 Bar closed to residents at 11 30pm no snacks available 45 60 min wait for reception to service a drink snack request after 11 30pm Rooms very small ,0
 The bar closed at 11 and the barman did not ask anyone if they would like more drinks the bar was full he proceeded to close the shutter and walk out Would of liked notice more revenue for the hotel as most of the residents would of purchased another drink ,0
 Invited to wait for our room to be ready by having a drink in the bar Waited 15 minutes for bar staff but no one arrived to serve us ,0
 The so called Superior Double Room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated Club Room and not a superior room Also we checked in at 11 00 hr and returned at 23 15 hr to be told that there was a minimum of a 1 hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available We also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered ,0
 Room was tiny No where near what I would expect from a superior room Been in London premier Inn s that were literally twice the size ,0
 Paid for a double superior room but it certainly did not feel like a superior Had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the bedroom and there was hardly any space to move around The price of the room was too much for what we had ,0
 The room was snug not too room to walk around the bed And the scrambled eggs didn t really resemble scrambled eggs ,0
 Room was tiny Very disappointed Completely different from the pictures,0
 Price View from bedroom Over a noisy and untidy back yard ,0
 The staff never smiled and only ever said 3 words to me the whole time I was there I also got a poor view of their ventilation system For the money I paid I did not deserve a view of their ventilation ,0
 The room is way too small including the bathroom Lighting was also poor ,0
 We did have a small issue with the staff being unable to locate our luggage which was left with them on the day we were leaving This was resolved but still did worry me at the time ,0
 A little tired needs an up grade But must retain character Our superior room had little floor space no chairs to sit on no space by the bed You had to get on the bed from the front Surely you can t call this superior But still liked the overhaul character ,0
 The room is small and there s no elevator to the 8th floor ,0
 They left us outside of the room one day before check out because we have been told that we hadn t paid at the check in when they forgot to Ask us for the entire payment and asked for the first night After many discussions with the hotel manager we have been allowed access to the room They said they tryed to reach us via phone many Times and this is absolutelly false,0
 The room had all you would expect But v small and no natural light Expensive for what it was Had I had a better room I would have been v happy with hotel,0
 The room 704 was very small for a double The bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed There was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use The bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it This should not be classed as a 4 star hotel in my opinion The Reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests ,0
 I think we were downgraded to the basement even though booking was for a deluxe double The receptionist mumbled something about it when we checked in The room and en suite were tiny but clean ,0
 Room was far too small even for London standards You could not leave the case stand up as there was no where physically to put it a few feet more in the rooms would be less greedy this was a superior room ,0
 Had to change rooms due to being put in what almost seemed like a cupboard with no window and no room for our luggage being six months pregnant this wasn t acceptable as the room was very stuffy so we asked to change rooms new room was more spacious with a window but did have dirty marks on wall and very hard bed which was uncomfortable ,0
 Bed was uncomfy Room was very small even though I booked a deluxe Certain areas in need of decoration No extractor fan in bathroom and it floods when in shower due to small screen ,0
 Staff seamed very busy which caused them to forget about letting us know when our room was available so check in wasn t the time we expected which was VERY disappointing ,0
 Room was a little on the small size but adequate ,0
 Some minor maintenance issues no teabags on hospitality tray and curtain not hanging correctly so letting light in from early morning Some public areas in need of TLC Bar prices steep 5 for a Diet Cole and a Soda water ,0
 The room was very small despite being upgraded We did move to a similar grade room with a different layout but still short on space But never mind we were there to attend a concert and sightseeing London is amazing The black cab drivers were so friendly and chatty made us laugh ,0
 On the day we were to check in I missed a call at 11am letting me know that due to a boiler issue our booking would be transferred to a sister hotel in Paddington for our entire stay Having googled this boiler issue I found that many other previous guests had the same experience noting that in their experience this was in fact an overbooking issue rather than any boiler Upon arrival at the hotel I was told that a taxi would be called for us and we could check in at the sister hotel I asked if there was a member of management I could speak to about this matter I expressed my dissatisfaction and how the substitute hotel was not somewhere that I had chosen to stay I also cited the many booking com reviews about this boiler that I had found I was told that this was just something that happened to the 2 hotel boilers please note that guests were both checking in and out during this time After causing quite a fuss at reception the hotel found us a room in the hotel one would imagine that this would have been done in the first instance rather than relocating a guest However I was happy that my original booking had then been honoured ,0
 cockroach running across the carpet uncomfortable mattress rubbish outside the window being put in the basement shower so small you couldn t bend down to pick up the soap,0
 The weather but hey its England in summer ,0
 The bath shower water rained out onto the floor There was no shower curtain glass barrier to keep the water in the tub Caused more than the usual anxiety during use of the bathroom ,0
 Booked 4 rooms Double deluxe 1st room had obviously had smokers in Next room damp then settled for last room Very small not sure where deluxe was Also booked 3 other deluxe double rooms which were allocated to our colleagues when we arrived as they informed us of room numbers When colleagues arrived their rooms apparently had no hot water then rooms were locked and then had been given to other people They ended up in tiny single rooms not what we paid for They made us late for a very important appointment It seemed like this group of hotels were shipping people in and out of sister hotels Not at all happy ,0
 The room size and the bed are quiet small but that s how it is in most London I feel terrible for big sized people fitting in is a hassle ,0
 Tried to move us to a sister hotel that was in a terrible location so we made them shuttle us back wasting about an hour Rooms tiny Staff rude ,0
 that is possibly the smallest room i have ever stayed in at a hotel and i have stayed in a few and we were upgraded to a larger room i really didn t think you could cram a shower bath and toilet and basin into 2m2 but they managed it It was nice and clean but it was absolutely tiny and given the cost isn t cheap it is a big let down from the main part of the hotel ,0
 Buyer beware Bait and switch They tried to switch my reservation to another hotel charge me the same rate but the hotel they tried to move me to was a lesser hotel that would normally charge half the price I saw them doing this to other travelers too ,0
 The rooms and bathrooms are tiny House keeping didn t change the sheets once in the 3 nights I was there ,0
 Rooms are very small ,0
 it was fine fr me but the superior room was on the small side and I can imagine for larger folks this would be a bit oppressive ,0
 The room was too small the walls were marked to the point it s the first thing you notice about the room Unfortunately the room was a 2 3 at the very very most I left after a few hours ,0
 hmm the room appeared to be a bit smaller than we thought The interesting thing was that we had to climb a few steps after opening the door to a our room which is just enough to fit in a small writing desk a double bed and a bathroom the splash glass of the bathtub is too small We had to be carefully not to wet the floor Interesting experience afterall P,0
 Staff in breakfast area abrupt and no customer interaction or smiles Queue for breakfast took over 30 mins to be seated facilities are very small,0
 Moved to another sister hotel due to water leakage problem but driver dropped me at the wrong place Room too small Reserved for double bed but they gave me one small single bed ,0
 Rooms and bathrooms were a bit small but everything was provided for so no worries ,0
 No porter at front door Hard for some drag big bag up ,0
 Our room was rather small We also had to go down a flight of stairs as soon as you open the door The door open in word and there was not enough room on the landing for person in the door ,0
 The room a superior deluxe was the smallest room I ve ever stayed in Very little space Two adults could not stand either side or at the end of the bed together More of a single than a double let alone a superior deluxe ,0
 I was very annoyed with the check in They wanted to move me to another partner hotel in Paddington due to problem with heating They rang earlier in the day suggesting this I completely refused and was eventually given a room in this hotel but I dislike the way this was done and it was almost a favour to give me the room I had booked ,0
 Tiny rooms Repeated requests to hotel staff to provide extra coat hangers which eventually arrived a couple of hours later Rip off prices in the bar 9 for a single gin and tonic No window able to be opened for fresh air Air con noisy This room was the biggest room I d refuse to stay in the smaller rooms Paid 180 per night but could ve got it for 120 if I d booked a couple off days before ,0
 It wasn t really a problem for 1 night but the bathroom was really small Very clean and well maintained though ,0
 Normally I am critical of London Hotels but this one has no problems at all,0
 According to the escape map behind the door i believe my room should be the smallest in this hotel there are even no place for me to open the luggage,0
 Description of rooms Superior Deluxe and Club none of them were applicable to the rooms we were shown The club room should be graded standard,0
 The room was tiny I am pretty sure they did not measure it accurately Always getting in each others way The bathroom was also a nook and not much hanging room ,0
 the room is fairly small compared to other hotels I stayed in London before the hairdryer is really old the rear side is widely open no mesh filter which is almost a given in any recent design I got a chunk of my hair sucked in had to ask for a scissors to cut my hair ,0
 Very small cosy bedroom bathroom ,0
 Everything Did not enjoy my 2 nights stay and wouldn t recommend to anyone I was on business so my company was paying if I had to use my own money I woukd give it a rating of minus 10 Not a happy customer,0
 Did not have any evening service in restaurant also the menue for room service was very limited,0
 I don t think guests should be offered a discount just to pre book breakfast anyone paying to stay should be offered breakfast at the same price ,0
 Small rooms I mean very smell we couldn t even walk around the bed and that s all the space we had Impossible to get undressed or move about Bathroom was even worse We did get a refund on our breakfast due to complaining about our room ,0
 There was no changing room or area in the toilets for guests who had already booked out and had baggage stored for the day ,0
 Don t be disillusioned by the pretty pictures Staff was rather rude to us and lacked complete understanding of english language None of the staff appeared to be native speakers Room was extremely small and we had to use a stairs to get from bathroom to sleeping area which also makes the space advertised as larger than it really is Even being a very slim person myself I couldn t reach the other side of the bed without moving the furniture Window could not be opened as it was half covered by the balcony wall and floor The air conditioning was very dusty ,0
 The superior room which we were supposed to have was a little small and the 6 or 7 steps down to the bathroom were a little inconvenient but not so bad as to spoil our stay ,0
 The mattress was ok but not as comfortable as it could be I cannot recommend this hotel for those with ambulatory issues because there is no access other than stairs at the entrance There were also stairs to enter my room but I understand there are other rooms without Otherwise a hidden gem ,0
 The price we paid for our stay we were disappointed with the room we thought it was on the small side and the bathroom was compact Also for the price I think breakfast should have been included ,0
 I cannot fault this hotel at all ,0
 The room was on the lower level and was very small and the bathroom was tiny The shower stall was 2 x 2 My 6 3 husband could barely stand up in it and it would have been impossible for him to raise his arms to wash his hair So ridiculous Not worth over 200 a night ,0
 Room was tiny and had to enter up staircase immediately inside room door and shower sprayed all over bathroom due to tiny shower screen,0
 The room was very small and the green security light over the door was much too bright I could not sleep because of this ,0
 Certain Reception staff less than helpfull Cleaning supervisor agressive Manager advised who gave his attention ,0
 there was no phone signal in my room which made me stressed of not being able to receive important phone calls ,0
 The bathroom was really small hate small bathrooms but then we only really slept in the room so weren t there really as we were out all day ,0
 I expected to get body lotion and had to purchase some at a nearby store Only shower gel and shampoo was provided ,0
 The room we stayed in was in need of a bit of a refurb The wallpaper looked tatty and blinds were broken this was a little disappointing and I did contemplate asking to be moved However we were on a tight schedule for the day so didn t want to get upset over it Rooms are very small ,0
 the lavatory is incredibly small I was living in the room 114 which is a so called club room If you are a big guy and right handed you will absolutely find it difficult cleaning yourself after using the toilet,0
 On arrival had to wait to check in and was then asked to move to another hotel I firmly refused and was promptly allocated a room I asked staff to confirm my booking of a superior double would be honoured I was told it would be Room so small I had to climb over bed to get into it It was however comfortable and I will no doubt use the hotel again even though I am still not sure if the room I got was a superior double How small must a standard double be ,0
 I found the room a bit cold and the thermostat did not seem to be controlled from the room ,0
 The only negative is that the restaurant is not open in the evening but there are plenty of eateries nearby,0
 Towels were so rough they exfoliate with every use Sheets could use some fabric softener too ,0
 Noise from fellow guests unhappy baby next door ,0
 We were very disappointed in the size of the room even though we chose a superior double room also very disappointed in view from our window which was a very scruffy block of flats,0
 A room that was a matchbox for my money Superior room NOT Dirty nets Curtains dated Decor untidy paintwork shabby and marked scuff marks No water in room for a 4star hotel Website very misleading have you seen the rooms on the 7 th floor wouldn t put my pet up there Would not recommended this hotel even with my last breath I felt I wasted my money and time staying there it was disgusting for a four star hotel The entrance is one big front and not in a good way Shaftsbury Hotels Will not ever be on my list to stay in ever again ,0
 only a little point the shower screen in our room could of been a little bigger to avoid wetting the floor so much,0
 We had to wait around half hour for our room to be prepared even though we could check in after 2 we still had to wait Although the staff we re apologetic and offered us tea and coffee it was still a nuisance to wait longer The bed was comofortable unfortunately there was holes in walls and black marks on the wall that was a little disappointing ,0
 The room size and consequently the double bed were really small and somewhat restricting on movement so much so I could not pass my wife in any part of the room without one of us having to our move aside for the other The view out of the window was none existent as it was directly onto a wall less than 2m away,0
 The fact because we booked threw you and ndt the hotel direct we had to pay 12 each for breakfast even though the hotel says breakfast is free for all our guesrs,0
 Sheets were not changed even when we put in a request with the receptionist who said she would have it seen to We had spilled coffee and would have appreciated our sheets changed but they were not its the only things that was not perfect ,0
 aost perfect just a warning they re isn t a huge vegetarian cooked breakfast options no vegi sausages but there is lots if choice for other breakfast things so it s not a problem,0
 Room not as spacious as would have liked ,0
 A lot of stairs but the staff upgraded my room to a ground floor room Lifts do not go to all floors,0
 the rooms are really tiny which does not make it a value for mony hotel ,0
 Room was very small decor rather shabby shower screen too small therefore floor got very wet ,0
 Staff that don t speak english well Seems to be the trend in London that the service industry is filled by eastern europeans that cannot convey ideas or understand queries Inconvenient small rooms with even smaller bathrooms Had a room on 8th fl which is reached via elevator to the 7th and then a snakey passage with steps Anyone over average size would not be able to move in these rooms and the hallways are claustrophobic The closet so small that 5 days worth of clothes wouldn t fit shoes had to stay on the floor behind the door which had a great expanse of wall begging for a row of hooks for coats and sundries Those we had to lay on the suitcase rest The desk in the corner was essential to laying things down the kettle and the hairdryer in the drawer however too close to the bed kept hitting my toes and hips on the corner It could have used a mini fridge underneath The last and most important thing for any hotel is a comfortable bed These were 3 4 beds Smaller than a double and HARD as rock I ordered an extra comforter to place on top It helped somewhat ,0
 room size very small bathroom you couldnt physically get in without having to stand over the toilet to close the door Bar very basic poor quality of towels bed sheets etc ,0
 Room was very small Difficult getting in and out the bed So close to the window View was awful ,0
 The room was absolutely tiny you couldn t even really walk The windows couldn t be closed so it was freezing cold and extremely noisy in the room Moreover the air con didn t heat the room either The furniture is old and totally worn down scratches and marks everywhere The Shampoo is a joke it s like it s gluing your hair together so you can t brush it anymore no conditioner has been provided Generally it s a very dark and uninviting hotel I don t understand why people rate it so high I will not come back definitely not 4 stars in my opinion ,0
 Creaky floors uncomfortable pillows leaking iron one staff member who delivered my iron when I asked does this not come with a board replied grumpily I was told to only bring iron and walked off in a huff to get an ironing board ,0
 Basement room so I was disinclined to open window for air Security wise Outlook awful also Noisy fridge buzzing away all night in cupboard beside bed,0
 Stuff poor very slow to check in The room very very small not as in the picture looks bigger and the bed very small for two The room was not very clean and towels really old and not clean well I will never come back to this hotel as all ,0
 Toilet was positioned so it could not be used for what it was designed for Therefore we had to go elsewhere to use the toilet ,0
 I don t like to complain but the room was on the small side ,0
 Bedroom was far too small and the bathroom was so small that you cannot get in without closing the door after you step halfway in Just no space and silly steps right at the bedroom door to get to the bed ,0
 The price should come down by at least 10 15 A little extortionate I thought ,0
 Place was a little noisey and the deluxe room was very small for the price The bed was hard ,0
 Well given it wasn t the hotel I booked I can t really say much about it despite having booked 14 days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy I was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault Not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in London hotels I realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms It happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller 180 for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that I stay in ,0
 Cleaners walking in when I m half naked Fire alarms going off first thing but no one bothered to say it was a mistake The room was awful ,0
 The room was tiny No bath The access to the room was blocked but staff did not tell me about the correct way to reach my room I was enrolled onto some premium club without explanation ,0
 I arrived late to be told had an upgrade to a room with a king size bed after the worlds slowest check in I opened my room door to find two twin beds I phoned reception to ask to be moved to a room with a double bed that I had booked Reception informed they had no more rooms available however they would make my twin beds into a double The lady on reception and a waiter arrived to make the bed It took them 45 minutes meaning I didn t get into my room until 10 30pm a night Check out was incredibly slow the lady on the desk took around 15 minutes to check people out ,0
 Upon arrival tried to shift our booking across to a sister hotel in Paddington no explanation why but we refused Given our triple deluxe room which was really poor Cramped room was tatty and looked onto a square concrete storage area full of drinking water containers Manager offered concessions in an attempt to satisfy Hotel is grand but room we experienced was 2 star ,0
 Told I had been upgraded to a large double from a single not enough room to open wardrobe door and you only had access to one side of the bed ,0
 Perhaps the addition of other spaces like a gym ballroom or other public facilities would make it more appealing to more travelers ,0
 The room which is supposed to be their deluxe room slightly bigger than the superior rooms according to this web site was way too small The facilities were not satisfactory no mini bar and no gym ,0
 Cleanliness a little lacking Dried globs of white stuff on drapes Would not care to guess origin Didn t notice until I pulled them shut Too tired to change rooms ,0
 The room was exceptionally small You would not want to share this room with another person The shower didn t have a full screen so the bathroom floor got very wet No towel available to step onto from shower Stairs going down into the room were very dangerous especially as I wasn t warned ,0
 Air con didn t work shower head was loose run out off wine and beer meant to be a double room ended up being to single beds poorly spoken English speaking staff ,0
 The floors squeezed a lot Because of this we had to move from 5th floor to 6th floor ,0
 Superior Double room over egging the description somewhat the rooms were small and cramped ,0
 A little more room ,0
 Rooms are not spacious but typical for London Otherwise room was fine ,0
 Could have supplied more toiletries in the room room was small ,0
 One of our party was moved to a sister hotel after his room allegedly had no hot water We were not informed of this till check in I paid 115 for him a double delux room and what he actually got was once moved a shoe box They even tried to charge us again for the room on more the one occasion Ordered room service 3 times none of which were correct My partner is dairy intolerant the sandwich she ordered had cheese in it Even though it did not say that on the menu We were assured it would be removed from the bill Howver we were charged on check out Check out is 12noon but was woken at 9 30am by housekeeping wanting to clean our room ,0
 The building is very old so not very practical for disabled or elderly guests as there are steps into the building and steps on each floor although there is a lift ,0
 We had read some bad recommendations about this hotel usually redirects to their clients to other hotels overbooking for sure This was true As soon as we arrived they tried to do it I needed to confirm my pregnancy in order they took 5 minutes in giving as a room I think this is not very professional My husband also confirmed 2 months before that weekend was my birthday and their hotel was part of my present and nobody had any deference about it We also ask for an additional blanket on Sunday and we needed to call twice to Front Desk in order they brought it we had it after almost 1 hour ,0
 The small chunky cups and saucers Bigger mugs please Now I am being picky ,0
 Room very small despite being called a deluxe double Feet hanging off the end of the bed Bathroom small difficult to stand under the shower which mostly went on the floor Also had open staircase in the room at the foot of the bed ,0
 Rooms rather small But that s London Very poor selection of TV stations Bring your tablet and netflix ,0
 VERY Squeaky floors both in own room and room above Heard the noise from the corridor very easily too ,0
 the room quality is really bad very small and even there s no room available I was relocated to other address wasting much time and complicated ,0
 I was upgraded with no extra perks not sure how that is an upgrade Did not find the staff to be as helpfull in fact one did not seem interested Rooms need a paint as there is cracks in the ceiling,0
 Quite expensive for what you get Tiny room smaller than the cruise cabin we just finished The entire room tilted yes tilted ,0
 The bar had no amaretto two days running which was a disappointment to my guest Club room very small bathroom tiny Not a great view,0
 The room was extremely small for a twin room and very hot at night as they turn off the AC centrally and the room 410 only had a small window The young was closed for functions ,0
 Very small bathroom with a very very tiny sink,0
 Rooms are size of the locker and with the stairs onsude a 12m2 rooms feels like you are in the attic ,0
 Room was very small altough i got a better category and noisy from the floor above The bathroom was extremely small it was hard to close the door with me inside The room was a bit strange with stairs between the bathroom and the actual bedroom The windows also hadn t any view that with the room size it became a bit claustrofobic ,0
 The maid tried to just walk into the room in the morning without knocking which I found to be rude and unprofessional ,0
 room sizes were quite small we booked a superior room only to discover that this was equivalent to a standard room elsewhere,0
 Club room was a bit small but perfectly adequate for a 1 night stay ,0
 The room was on the small size,0
 Room small but hey this is London,0
 No Signal for mobile Lower Ground Floor Always had to come out of building to make a phone call ,0
 The air con seemed to make a bad smell come into the room at one point which we reported It disappeared when we turned it off ,0
 We booked double supreme but were allocated with a twin double On top of that room was no way near dusted we could see that dust flying all over in the room Next night was far better because we got a club room yet again with twin single beds but room nice tidy spacious ,0
 The Rooms are small There is not enough space to move around ,0
 Room slightly small but comfortable and well presented ,0
 The room is very small It is hard to walk if we open just one luggage The bed is also very small and uncomfortable If you live underground it could be so depressive ,0
 The air circulation was pretty bad in our room the small window only opened a tiny bit and this was a cause of discomfort due to lack of fresh air ,0
 On arrival they offered an upgrade to what they said was a larger room The room was the size of a shoe box and the bed was described as a double to which it wasn t At one point in the night I woke up with my partners elbow in my mouth as literally no room in the bed Definitely not worth 160 for 1 night and not even breakfast oh and the shaver sockets don t work,0
 Our room was quite small but included bed desk and bathroom with very little space ,0
 My room was very small but to be expected for a london hotel ,0
 I upgraded from a standard room But what I got was still pathetic A room no bigger than 8x8 with a pretend window that opened into a corridor I shudder to think what i would ve had if I hadn t upgraded ,0
 Came for an early check in but the room was not ready Staff had told to wait in the front lounge but never came back for any updates ,0
 Room was a bit on small side but obviously you don t spend much time in there 4 50 charge for large bottle of water think that s probably normal for room service but tad overpriced in my opinion,0
 The room and bathroom are very tight impossible to walk between the bed and furniture suitcases on the floor Bathroom sink is ridiculously small With pullout bed in this suite there is no room to get around This is not really a hotel no dining room only used for breakfast The lobby sitting room is dark and not our taste Adam s family gothic Not a good sign to see people standing on the doorsteps smoking when we arrived Looking out the window of pullout bedroom window is no joy dirty and stack of empty water bottles ,0
 Ref Room 109 1 Strong noise specially from bathroom s ceiling spreading into bedroom at night seriously disturbing proper sleep Cause aeration system 2 Poor lightening system ,0
 Poor room location being on the basement and below ground level so didn t have much of a view Difficult to communicate with staff seemed to be due to a lanuage barrier ,0
 Despite initial appearance and online room photos room was very small for the price paid and compared to what was shown and expected for this 4 star hotel dissappointing,0
 Staff were friendlier this time than last but a smile would still make all the difference Just do some basic staff training in courtesy and friendliness ,0
 Needs complete renovation very shabby short beds literally although I m not a tall person 1m68 Blinds were broken even in the superior room ,0
 The room was incredibly small So was the bed My husband is over 6ft so half his legs were hanging off the end ,0
 I was greeted with the information there was no accommodation for me that I would have to be accommodated in a sister property There was mild surprise I had not received prior Informatio but that did not ring true I politely but firmly refused alternative premises and guess what a room materialised I needed to be in that area for personal reasons but that is beside the point I had booked in Inverness Terrace because that was where I wanted to be This was poor stuff and I would like your comments as the booking agents You have always served me well in the past Moira Lawson,0
 The Club room an upgrade was very small especially the bathroom It took a bit of getting used to but the pros still outweighed the cons We re coming back in June ,0
 Headroom in shower Also two inch gap at bottom of bedroom door had to fill gap with towel to stop light flooding in when we put lights off ,0
 The rooms are extremely small as I had booked superior double I was disappointed but didn t let it ruin the trip I suppose this is to be expected in London for the price ,0
 The room was very very small Upon arrival I was told that I was upgraded to club room this room was extremely small God only know the size of my original room ,0
 It rained on the Monday ,0
 The room was very very small Didnt have any great expectations but I could almost touch all 4 walls while sitting on the double bed ,0
 Mattress needs replacing sagging in the middle and could feel a spring Couldn t open blinds ,0
 Couldn t find a remote control and could not activate the air con ,0
 room was very small but the price was good so i guess that reflects the room size,0
 Noisy road works quite early in the morning Maintenance came to look at the shower whilst I was in it Room wasn t all that big and we d been upgraded but was fine for what we needed ,0
 The bathroom was small though and a large person would have had very little space in the shower ,0
 Too much noise around the room Contact the duty manager but never reported back i had to call hik another 2 times to send someone to check it Very noisy at all time in morning ,0
 Ineffective heater in the room Shower cubicle too small and close to the ceiling Very small rooms Being told that the hotel was too full and I would have to move to a hotel close by ,0
 We were told that our room had been upgraded I would not have liked to stay in the previous one The room was very small and had no air conditioning making it very hot ,0
 We did have to move due to not having a double twin as booked But they moved us to a sister hotel in the area included breakfasts and couldn t be more apologetic or helpful ,0
 The only thing I would say is the room was very small really not what I expected for a club double Could have have also done with a little decoration in places Might be a good idea to put on the website that the rooms are small One other small thing was that there were complimentary drinks in the fridge but no bottle opener to open them with,0
 Yes rooms are compact lol but very clean and to be fair when you visit London you are only really putting your head down so don t actually spend that much time in the room Well I don t anyways ,0
 The location is good the building lay out is very nice most of staff are v nice friendly The room was so basic in facilities like tea coffee shower gel body cream which was none The towels bed sheets smell really bad to the extent that I develop skin rashes the mattress pilows were uncomfortable ,0
 I booked a club room which in itself was fine along with the little extras but the bathroom The sink was so small Why bother When I leant over to try and brush my teeth and rinse my face the stupidly placed glass shelf above stopped me What idiot designed that Love the hotel but paying for a club room and getting a bathroom cupboard is just not acceptable The bathroom could have been made 1 2 metre wider and had a decent wash basin Puts me off staying again,0
 Old style windows were in a fixed position they could not be opened or closed Gaps in the window frames allowed noise from the street to be heard clearly in the room at day and at night Draughts could also be felt coming through the windows The hotel restaurant was only used for breakfast only rather expensive room service was available at other times of the day Handy to have lots of stores and restaurants in the next street so you can pop out and get food for yourself ,0
 Having a laugh to describe the room as a deluxe double Open door and immediately faced with a flight of stairs up to the bed area which you had to negotiate separately as no room to swing a cat Bathroom equipment ok but pokey for a deluxe ,0
 Working desk space in room not really usable because to small ,0
 the size of the room of course we re in London and I ve slept even in smaller rooms but still I can t help but find it extremely annoying can t really have space for the suitcase no minibar and the desk is really impossible to use without feeling contrained There was a nasty damp smell in the room The windows are rather old ok so s the building but the draft coming from outside was not pleasant thankfully the heavy curtains helped ,0
 A little cold at night because I did not find the air conditioning regulator until the morning My own fault but the print is small ,0
 Breakfast was quite expensive ,0
 Instructions to switch on the heating air con could be improved and be made more readily available alongside the other hotel information in the room ,0
 1 No refrigerator in the room had to keep some food I bought with the receptionist 2 The lower ground floor room was noisy because of poor insulation I could hear people who were walking on the pavement 3 No shower curtains 4 Very small room ,0
 The room was besides the housekeeping store Up from 7 am it was loud and hard to sleep ,0
 Better quality toiletries even if it s an additional cost Eg Overnight toiletries from Moulton Brown or another quality make would have saved me the hassle of bringing my own ,0
 Tiny room with no view but at least they made an effort at cheerfulness by placing flowers in the windows that you look out at ,0
 There seemed to be huge communication difficulties We asked at booking for two twin rooms or if that was not possible then two single duvets on each double bed Acquiring the single duvets seemed to be the most difficult thing in the world to achieve I lost count of how many attempts it took but it included getting two extra double duvets for each room various doubles and singles and eventually two singles arrived with two duvet covers to put on ourselves not good except they weren t duvet covers they were sheets Two covers were subsequently requested and arrived given to us to put on ourselves except one was a double By this time it was about 12 30am The receptionist was profusely apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast At breakfast we asked for 1 coffee 2 teas and 1 fruit tea We got 1 coffee and two fruit teas When I pointed out the mistake we were brought 1 more tea At this point we gave up and my daughter and I shared the tea When we were leaving my daughter phoned reception and asked if they could book a taxi to take us to the station but when we arrived downstairs the receptionist said she d forgotten to do it Not good we very nearly missed the train All in all it was quite tiresome ,0
 The rooms were small and very tired All needs refurbishment My initial room was so tiny and required going up a few stairs to get to the bed The quilt was too small for the bed and I could hear people talking Asked to change rooms and was given a better room slightly larger which was appreciated Have stayed in better hotels in London for less ,0
 Very small bed small shower with a light very close above the showerhead toilet stuck around the side of the shower and a small room to boot also the fire alarm going off at 4 30 45 am just finished things off lovely ,0
 The bathroom was small so if you are some over 6 foot just be aware there is not much room for you ,0
 The offers did not include breakfast You would rather buy a full package This was an unexpected surprise ,0
 The mattress was hard and you could feel the springs And the cornered handrail in the bath was impractical because you keep on catching your back on it,0
 Bedroom very small cupboard in wrong place as left small floor space to bed English Language a problem for some staff to understand ,0
 Superior double for 2 Couldn t swing a cat Couldn t even get dressed without hitting the wall with an elbow Quilt just reached edge to edge Would have been a fight for two ,0
 I had a lower ground floor and you could hear the underground trains below Not the only hotel to have this though ,0
 The bedroom was really cold and had single glazing Apparently we could ve turned the radiators on using the air conditioning That wasn t explained to us and there was no welcome pack in the room Our room was at the front of the hotel and I had a disturbed night s sleep from a lot of noise in the street Also breakfast was so expensive we didn t choose it Finally we chose the delux room supposed to be the bigger option but it was tiny The bedroom door couldn t even open fully ,0
 Size of room was small even when I was upgraded rooms due to maintainence issues Size of bathroom also very small Hotel lobby very dark due to original dark wood walls Requires more lighting ,0
 Only thing was the room was a little small with no view a brick wall with a picture on it ,0
 We were charged too much when checking in and it took us a while before we received the refund back We never received a proper bill to explain what went wrong in the first place even after several times asking for a state of payment ,0
 What they call a superior double room is a BOX room I wouldn t recommend staying there if you want a couple of days Also it seems when you arrive reception fill you with a sob story that 38 rooms are out of order so the booking has to be amended even though no prior warning is given via a courtesy call or email they recommend moving you to a sister hotel down the room We put up a bit of a fight saying we didnt want to move and wanted what we booked which ended up being a box room As we were walking away they seem to use this trick on another couple who arirved shortly after claiming there were no rooms for them seems to me they want you to book that specific hotel and when you arrive give you some sob story about the rooms being out of order How many other people have they tried this on It s value for money if you re not messed around ,0
 Welcome at Reception wasn t great Room very small would like to know what the standard doubles are like however was ok for 2 nights Bathtube needs bigger screen No mini fridge,0
 No opening window or view was probably the only downside but it was a cold few days and to be honest I was staying there while attending a conference so the view wasn t so important ,0
 the rooms are far too small for a couple I have asked to have a larger room and the staff accomodated me but the improvement was minimal in the new room ,0
 The only real issue for us was the mattress which could have been firmer for more comfort ,0
 Room was upgraded to a basement room that wasn t much larger than bed I d hate to have seen my booked room Later discovered that the original person who was to stay in that room complained and was given OUR room We were tripping over ourselves No room for our cases Room smelled of smoke for over a day Staff was very aloof Hade to ask for the iron board and it didn t come the first day ,0
 I found x3 body hairs in my bathroom which were not mine This was really not good ,0
 Small room for the money paid more was expected Wouldn t recommend for this reason We were told on arrival that we were being given a free upgrade but I hate to think what our original booking was if this was considered an improvement ,0
 On arrival we were told we were upgraded to a club room which according to the receptionist was one of their largest rooms When we got to our room is was very small We had barely enough room to walk around the bed We had booked a superior room so I d hate to think how small this would have been Having said that it was very clean and comfortable ,0
 Room bathroom quite small which wasn t an issue as we didn t spend much time there Floorboards were very creaky we could hear the guests upstairs moving around Didn t really impact too much on our stay though ,0
 This weekend was booked for a gift for my father in laws 70th birthday I saaid this on the booking I was disapponted to know they had a 2 1 2 hour wait for the room and the room was like a box So the whole point of a special weekend was slightly over shadowed,0
 Was upgraded to a club room but this was still minute Couldn t walk around the bed Paid more for a family room but extra space was not around the bed Don t try to check in early Staff had poor English ,0
 Our ground floor room was very small ,0
 Upon arrival we were shifted to a sister hotel because of boiler problems The hotels are rated four star but should be rated two star The tv had bad reception Room service only left body cream and shower gel the first night The room was extremely small and closet space inadequate Breakfast was fair with limited selection ,0
 Room was absolutely tiny despite been told we had been upgraded to a Club Room The toilet was far too small especially the actual size of the shower The service in the bar and restaurant was beyond slow and food was bad ,0
 Check in process was long Could do with extra staff in busy periods to help out Room was small but not much different in size to the standard London hotel room,0
 everything else poor wine in the evening cold room heating wasn t working on a sub zero February night no where to box and a box room you couldn t swing a cat in,0
 I hated the bathroom Taking a shower was so hard the room was so tiny we couldn t fit despite it wasnt the smallest room Staff was not very welcoming ,0
 Size of the bed and room Reception staff weren t very attentive while trying to check in she served 3 or 4 people while I was trying to pay ,0
 Rooms were small but still everything you need was there Didn t realise how much you could squeeze into the tiniest bathroom I have ever seen ,0
 The size of the room was a bit tight for 2 adults but yet sufficient for good rest ,0
 I don t approve of the staff removing plates from the table when the other person is still eating The British way is both plates are removed at the same time I found this made my experience of my meal very uncomfortable which is a shame because the food was lovely ,0
 I didht luke the rooms r very tiny and i didht like the reception girl martha which when i ask her to change room ahe lie to me and she told me is overbooked and dont have other room but when i speak with the manager suddenly she washt overbooked the hotel and i change room ,0
 Rooms were awful Hotel pulls you in with the nice looking lobby them boom Your trapped in a small box that s barely of 1 quality Also hotel cancelled first reservation so while I was half way to London I had to book another room wish I d booked a different hotel as that should have been a sign Very disappointed,0
 The bathroom was not clean enough The windows were not well insulated so cold air kept creeping under them The bathroom smell was musky the ventilation was not working ,0
 Mould around window and window was dirty and also couldnt get in safe in wardrobe as the bed amd side cabinet was too close,0
 Room was smaller than expected bathroom was very cramped in particular and shower was rubbish ,0
 On arrival the hotel room was not clean I was very disappointed also it did ruin my evening In saying that the way it was dealt with was brilliant I am extremely grateful for the night manager and some of the staff as they made it right as soon as they could ,0
 The room a Deluxe double was just off the main staircase with a potentially injurious lack of space between the door to the room and the door to the staircase The window looked out on the acces ramp of an underground car park and service entrances to restaurants on Queensway making it noisy and insalubrious Deluxe is not a word I would have used ,0
 There was no space under the bed for my to hide and prank my girlfriend,0
 Bedroom very small Clean and comfortable with nice bathroom but small ,0
 I think this may be a London wide problem and I also have good hearing but I could hear the tube from my room on the ground floor throughout the night and morning The room could have been a bit cleaner I think the turn around is very busy There seemed to be a constant flow of guests which must put staff under pressure it lacked the finish I expect of a hotel and shows the difference between a 4 London hotel and 5 There was a slight mix up with our room but The manager and staff were more than accommodating to resolve this and went above and beyond to make it right and they improved my stay by doing so I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use again the next time I return to London Any points I didn t like are simply little things ,0
 N A,0
 Breakfast was overpriced for what you got and the room was very small ,0
 N A We didn t stay there long enough to notice anything we didn t like ,0

 The rooms were small however for the amount of time we spent there it really didnt matter Location way more important beds were comfortable and it was spotlessly clean ,0
 We had problems with our pram and there was no lift available for us to the first floor so the stairs were a nightmare followed by more steps as you enter the tiny cramped bedroom Not child friendly or suitable for disabled access ,0
 The double bed was something else The mattress was extremely hard we hardly slept at all The bedcover was very thin and not wide enough to cover two people We would not stay there again ,0

 Problems with holding deposits for hotel Room we stayed in on second floor one side of corridor bit small for a couple staying Smell of smoke in room ,0

 They had called me before I arrived to Transfer me to another hotel because they have a maintenance work but I refused It took me 10 minutes to check in My room was deluxe but they upgrade it to club room which was so small the bathroom area was about 0 5 M by 1 M the sink was so small like a large soup plate and its was hard to adjust the tube to get warm water No phone signal at all because my room was in basement ,0
 Well the staff were quite rude they got my information wrong and even told my girlfriend what I had ordered when it was meant to be a surprise food was cold morning and night and was interrupted twice by staff,0
 The staff at the reception was rude I had checked my account before leaving to go to the hotel and had seen that they had charged me according to the policy I had booked under The receptionist then informed me that this was not the case and that they were going to charge me again constantly telling me the first charge was a pre authorisation He was not willing to listen this was a frustrating and bad start to our stay The rooms are small which I was expecting due to it being in the centre of London but I did not appreciate the fact that the beds were not long enough Going to the toilet was pretty much impossible there is no space at all They supply a kettle in the room but the tap in the bathroom is so small that you cannot fill the kettle there we had to use the showerhead Not good ,0
 Window didn t close properly and it was freezing at night Mattress is awful Duvet is really low quality Duvet cover does not fit the duvet and linen do not fit the mattress Noisy corridor Room and bathroom are tiny Staff are not very nice ,0

 The temperature of the room could have been more adjustable it was cold night and higher temp of the room would have been better,0
 When I turned up I was put in someone else s room then when complained they said the room I had booked was being refurbished was very disappointed then the room we ended up with was very poor window wouldn t stay open had to wedge open with a spoon Single size quit on double bed ,0

 Booking not honoured Involuntarily transferred on arrival to associated hotel 200m away which while adequate lacked the character of the Grand Royale No prior consultation Unacceptable ,0

 First room had a very noisy extractor fan outside it and I had to be moved This was done with no fuss and very quickly ,0
 I got a upgrade to a club room which is basically in the basement don t recommend getting that room It was really run down and just kinda filthy It says it was a non smoking hotel but I constantly smelled smoked in my room The shower was really small and the bed uncomfortable ,0
 I think the guy working in the bar 4th feb night around 9pm has some problem I ordered for the drink but he only served to other customers and i asked twice for the drink again he only said if you just sit down there i will bring up the drink and then i just left after 20 mins waiting and wasting since he has been serving other customers continually but not to me the bar was not even busy at all ,0
 There was a problem with the security system in bedroom 205 this caused some concern with the maintence team and my friend ,0
 When we arrived we were sent to another hotel because of some rooms being out of order We didn t like this since the other hotel was of a lower standard the room was tiny and the breakfast wasn t very good especially the coffee was bad just not what we booked But on the next day we went back to the Grande Royal to tell them of our dissatisfaction and they offered us an upgraded room and free breakfast for the rest of our stay We really appreciated this gesture thank you very much ,0

 The room size was adequate but the bathroom was too small and the shape made it difficult to use the very small sink and toilet ,0

 I am not sure I can grade the hotel i never actually stayed in it they called me and said the boiler had broken down and could I transfer to a different hotel but then see the days the builder broken down there were other guests in the hotel Perhaps they were laid shifting ,0
 The bathtub is too open then the bathroom was totally wet after shower ,0
 It wasn t an issue for me but there were some stairs down into the room as soon as you went through the door may not be suitable for those who have trouble with stairs so worth double checking when you book check in ,0

 While the room was moderately comfortable it was very small and lacked finesse The sheets didn t fit the bed the shower head did not appear to work properly and the bathroom door wouldn t close These were small inconveniences but for the cost of the room I would not have expected them ,0
 The hotel staff made a mistake on the date of my Heathrow shuttle booking which did not arrive on my check out date It was only after I waited for 40mins and asked the hotel staff to call the shuttle company before they realized the mistake I had to make last minute alternative arrangements to Heathrow airport and was nearly late for my flight ,0

 Room was terribly small and the bathroom was even smaller I think this is typical for most European hotels I am from the U S and accustomed to larger facilities but it was very small for two people Also we were in the basement meaning we had a terrible view and the one window we did have was drafty and leaked in wind all night long causing the person sleeping nearest the window to freeze ,0
 Unfriendly and unhelpful staff They did not have any information on various questions such as parking in the neighbourhood or where to watch the New Year fireworks they actually advised us to go Trafalgar Square where it was not screened and not possible to watch ,0
 Bathroom was a little small and the rooms were plain compared to the lobby other than that it was good just thought they didn t keep in tone of the hotel ,0

 The size of room is really small although they upgraded us to a club room which was at lower ground and even through the window we could not see the sky or anything else except a wall and an air condition fixed on it ,0
 The cost of the smallest room we have ever had in London We asked at the end of the stay why our water was not replenished and was informed only the first day was included in the price unless you are a club member We believe that for in excess of 500 pounds for a 72 hour stay bottled water would be included The fruit was a nice touch but removed when left and not replaced it would of been nice to leave it for the following day The basis of this hotels prices seems to be the grand entrance as the remained of the hotel is a very dated ,0
 The shower didn t have a curtain strange design feature ,0
 Asides breakfast no restaurant roomservice within the hotel So i have to make sure I eat before returning to the hotel or hold something to eat ,0

 room 611 was small and compact you could hear upstairs rooms and outside road breakfast was good but both mornings we went at 9 30 and the bacon and sausage was cold there were about 4 staff but they were not watching when people want serving half the time slow service for this priced hotel its a little out of main hubbs taxis expensive but tube station just around corner which is good I am not moaning senior management need to train staff to be more pro active watch the food so it doesn t go cold and smile ,0
 The breakfast was a dissapointment The food was wonderful but the service we found poor on asking for tea the used teapot was refilled Dishes were not removed ,0

 I was moved on to another hotel further up the street on my first night having paid 119 per night no breakfast it was unpleasant I accepted free breakfast on my two morning stay They seemed sincere and apologetic Bathroom in room 117 small and dated but ok considering it is a rustic full of character hotel ,0
 My arrival necessitated movement to a sister hotel due to a plumbing issue which was an inconvenience but well handled ,0
 Room temp too warm for me breakfast choice v good but not quite hot enough but acceptable lack of parking,0
 Even after insisting on a room change after the so called superior double transpired to be no more than a shoe box we were allocated a club room in the basement with a view of a wall no daylight The room was cramped and small and the bathroom was no bigger than a toilet cubicle with a tiny shower enclosure Even the sink in the bathroom was so tiny that you could not have used it to wash in ,0
 I m not usually one to write reviews but I am that unhappy and feel I need to warn people about how awful it is Upon arrival the foyer was impressive it s a very beautiful building with art on the ceilings but unfortunately the rooms were a very different story The duvet cover had a big yellow stain on it so we had to ask for a clean one but when we tried to call down to reception the buttons on the phone had been pushed in so we couldn t use it and we didn t even get an apology There were dirty marks all up the walls and curtains We ordered an English breakfast with tea but the tea never arrived The gap between the wall and one side of the bed was about 1ft so no space to move Our view was of other rooms At 11 30 we were packing to leave when a member of staff just barged in despite check out being at 12 Not happy at all with this hotel especially as we paid a lot of money We would not stay here again ,0

 REALLY small rooms and bathroom Breakfast is expensive and not worth it the coffee pace around the corner had better and cheaper breakfast Staff was unfriendly at check in but became better during our stay ,0
 On arrival we were advised without any apology that we would be moving hotels because they had booking issues We planned our trip around staying in that location and specifically wanted a traditional hotel not a modern one with dirty restaurant that we got moved to My wife was was pregnant and we did not want to be shuttled around hotels on what was meant to be a special weekend away We have not received a word of apology from the hotel after our visit ,0
 On arrival we were advised the hotel staff had organised alternative accommodation due to a plumbing issue with our room Our alternative accommodation did not have a double room they only a twin room available ,0
 Horrific I stay in London every week in 4 or 5 star hotels This isn t a 3 star in my opinion Dirty dated and grubby Shame for such a beautiful building ,0
 The room was tiny and shabby Marks on the walls and dated decor Very dusty also Water not replaced for second night of stay Very expensive with breakfast not even included Internet kept dropping constantly with need to keep entering password ,0
 There was an offer by the hotel on Booking com when I chose it and set my dates it confirmed to me a totally different date Thinking I was wrong I repeated the process but again the same result So I ended up paying for two nights at the same unwanted date I called the hotel but they told me that I have to call booking com I called booking com but they told me I have to call the hotel What a trap ,0

 Lift only to floor 7 and the a flight of stairs to floor 8 where the room was located No view from room,0
 I paid extra for the breakfast couldn t get in to eat dinning room full couldn t accommodate a table for 3 wanted us to sit 2 at one table 1 at another,0
 Rooms little small If you open your suitcase you will have to step over it to get to door or bathroom ,0
 Sadly for the price it costs its just not worth the money The deluxe room is TINY and this was an upgrade Dread to think what we would have got if we hadn t Not clean enough and looking tired which you wouldn t expect from somewhere of this price range and star ,0
 room to small for a double it did not feel like a deluxe room difficult to communicate with some of the staff,0
 The bedroom did not match the description on the website it was tiny and the bathroom was so small it was actually difficult to move in there We also paid extra for a club room but this just seemed to mean a bowl of fruit and a small bottle of wine were left in the room It was not the luxurious pampering advertised ,0

 The adequacy of the room size appears to be pot luck The room I was in for the second period of my stay was much better than the first see my other review following the first period of my stay ,0
 all the little stairs before you get to the room The shower door was very small no room to put your toiletries no room to hang the towel by the basin the walls were too thin I could hear my neighbor snoring the room service was only cold sandwiches ,0

 The staff who dealt with the initial arrival and stringent way they dealt with the hotel policy when they had no authority for specific information The misinformation the staff gave in relation to credit card provider and details of the credit card being passed to their finance dept when not authorised ,0
 The room was really quite small but for 108 per night from wowcher it was worth it considering the location There was quite a bit of noise in the early hours as the room was at the back of the hotel and backed onto shops getting they re deliveries etc And the air con heating didn t work properly flashed on the wall until I covered it with a towel Also the sink plug wouldn t close for my partner to have a shave in There was no view as the window was frosted we didn t eat in hotel maybe next time,0

 I thought the size of the room on arrival to be small disappointing misleading at time of booking The room didn t smell very clean I asked to be moved ,0
 Against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best 4sq m As a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long A final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there ,0
 did not have a bad experience at all the only recommendation would be to have a larger shower ,0

 The only little complaint I have is you need to clean the bathroom doors more often Mine was sticky The rest of the room was very clean though ,0
 We were given two single beds pushed together rather than the double that we thought we had booked The room was a bit of a dungeon might suit some but for this couple it was not a happy outcome to a romantic evening ,0

 We arrived at Royale Hotel at Hyde Park where they took my payment for the room It was only after they took my payment that they then told us that there was maintenance issues within the building so they would have to re locate us to another hotel in Paddington They paid for our taxi but told us the taxi would be with us in 5 mins however we were made to wait 30 mins before i had to again ask the staff how long it would be The hotel itself was really nice just the whole point of us having to be re located after i had already made payment was not acceptable ,0
 Our room was nice but was a little cramped trying to walk around the bed the TV didn t have good reception ,0
 I had a ground floor room The view was of a brick wall and at times you could hear the tube arriving departing although it didnt disturb my sleep The rooms are very small ,0
 Upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after 5 minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted She told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked We did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small When entering the room I immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls My partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat I turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so I ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust After informing the front desk and upon return to our room I was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned I decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath I had to annoyingly fiddle with it Then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until I forced it to pull back out On my first night I had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the Orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out I proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided After I finished writing I turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration We looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at However we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed My partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me Overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish ,0
 I know it was in a deal but the room was very small It was at the end of the top floor corridor in the eaves ,0
 Room was a bit small and breakfast was a little pricey but still within comfortable standards ,0
 Clean modern bathroom but very cramped,0
 We were moved from Grand Royale to Shaftesbury International up the road I agreed because I was told the replacement was the same standard It wasn t We were upgraded to a Club Room which was tiny Hair on floor in bathroom and hair in towels Specks of dirt in bed some sort of ironing residue The hotel was next door to some sort of hostel with a rowdy group of drinking buddies outside ,0
 Maybe I haven t got my head around London pricing yet but I couldn t understand why a glass of red wine and a bacardi coke in the Theater bar should cost considerably more than a breakfast We did get better value in bars located nearer the hotel ,0
 Deluxe Double Room is grossly misrepresented in the hotel s online advertising over a nine day stay my room was never cleaned properly and if luckily the bedding which was old and worn may have been changed 1 time On several occasions I saw the Front Desk Staff engage in quite unpleasant discussions with guests who arrived to find that their booking had to been honoured or those like myself who were very unhappy with the accommodation I was promised an upgrade to a Club Room after 1 night but the Front Desk never followed up on this ,0
 the room size is terrible small for us from ASIA to LONDON cant stay in this hotel because we cant even open one luggage No space to walk around and even place your products or hang your clothes the room is even smaller than JAPAN room I think winter period not advise for long haul flight to stay here do not have the space to place or even pack thing we need to hop around dam funny for us we are consider petite sizes and we need to hop around the room hahaha good work out for us this hotel is good for 3 days 2 nites short stay with one small bag ,0
 One small thing that could be improved is the glass shower screen on the bath shower was not big enough ,0
 Difficult to get around the bed duvet too small lovely view of the bins from neighbouring shops,0
 Decor is dreadfully bland and whole place feels soul less The reception and bar are particularly small and totally lacking in comfort not even enough chairs It is a beautiful old building but has been badly modernised and in no way is this a four star hotel APART from the great staff ,0
 A little expensive for the average traveller We were last minute booking or would have chosen elsewhere in the area They tried to bill us for breakfast we didn t have and very disorganized on check out ,0
 room was substandard for price and did not have fore poster bed nor queen size beds as per advert and confirmed by reception breakfast was wrong on both mornings bar closed at 11am no dining in the evening,0
 We were in room 026 Very noisy from 7am Doors banging constantly we could constantly hear the bleeping of a key pad followed by another door banging We had asked for a quiet room Also a small point re the wardrobe Hanging space not long enough for clothes perhaps one shelf should be taken out ,0
 Pricing of a single person 3 5x2 m room adjacent small shower was unreasonable I don t know how the picture of the bed was made It must have been made before they built the walls around the room Could not have been more than 50 cm between bed and wall on one side only Had to stack furniture on the cabinet to have access to bed from bathroom Unpractical cabinet to stow luggage while there was no room to leave it in the room ,0
 i booked a double room for 2 person but when i reached on that day they gave us 2 single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room ,0
 Every thing expansive room is dark no refrigerator the bathroom door is very old and locked us inside many times my mistake is I paid for my whole stay in advance ,0
 The room was very warm and we had to prop a window open to get fresh air The mattress was probably past its use by date The shower screen was not wide enough for us to stop water going onto the floor ,0
 As with many big cities rooms and bathrooms are quite small even in the Club rooms ,0
 The room was too small with VERY cerky floor poor sound proof low ceiling and very dirty window,0
 Room was a bit claustrophobic often seen in older UK properties Would appreciate a second chair so that both residents could sit simultaneously ,0
 Not quite walking distance to Paddington Room was small and oddly configured with about 8 stairs from the door to the room Breakfast was expensive coffee better around the corner ,0
 The room was tiny I have never stayed in a room so small ever The quilt was not big enough to cover both of us The bathroom is tiny and down a set of stairs No where to put anything because the room is so small ,0
 Although we were advised we had received an upgrade on our room our room was tiny Felt very claustrophobic especially in the bathroom e g very tight squeeze getting out of the shower hit my knee on the sink the first day Net curtains were dirty window broken and had a horrible view of a dirty alley from our window If this was the upgrade I dread to think what our original room would have been like For a 4 star hotel and the amount we paid I would not have expected any of these things ,0
 We had to climb a narrow staircase and walk along very narrow corridors to our room The room was too small for its description as a Superior Double If we had not benefited from a big room rate discount we should have been very dissatisfied ,0
 the rooms are a bit worn down and showing their age For the price and location its still a good deal ,0
 Bed very uncomfortable on last night for some strange reason Fine for rest of stay Spoilt the overall impression ,0
 The staff is friendly but not well organised They kept us waiting in front of them in the lobby for almost 2 hours for our room over the announced checkin time ,0
 Simple things the duvet was far too small for the bed The coffee and sugar were not replenished when asked When having a shower the screen was so small that water went all over the floor ,0
 Room very very small I booked a double and it felt claustrophobic for 1 glad there wasnt 2 of us No restaurant and room service menu limited Room needed redecorating and as an older female I would have appreciated a little help with my luggage up and down front steps No porter and reception ignored me I am a regular visitor to London and usually stay 4 5 star and I just feel grand royal could do better,0
 The room was very small and was quite stifling with no opening windows or room air conditioning ok for 1 night,0
 I choose a club room which I paid a little more for however although it had everything you would expect it was quite small with a window only 2 foot wide ,0
 We didn t try breakfast at the hotel as 15 seemed far too expensive ,0
 Everything the rooms are small and cramped the staff are just there not welcoming or even happy looking They freeze money in your account you at the bill on arrival and the don t free I your Monet until about three days after your stay Disgusting,0
 We requested them to change to a suite on day one since rooms were very small and they did not give us one ,0
 The only thing we didn t like is one of the managers on duty during the day showed very little concern for the customer Awful to have to deal with Fortunately the rest of the staff made up for him ,0
 The checking in and checking out processes are very slow with staff not taking any notice of people arriving Serving people in the wrong order is just annoying first come first served should be respected Not enough of a problem to be negative but be prepared to be assertive ,0
 Room was tiny Like a renovated closet yet everything was there as it was obviously well planned out ,0
 Room could be bigger but I can t complain given its ideal location in London ,0
 That rhe hotel did not have a dinner service or any out of hours room service if you felt hungry This is poor as where the hotel is based you can not buy any food after 11pm,0
 The room was very small although we got upgraded into a bigger room but still it was small The cleanses was poor ,0
 Rooms were small but this is reflected in the price so not bad value for money Public areas were nice ,0
 Room was quit small Check in was slow and complicated Some lack of information and misunderstanding of booking and payment Difficult to catch with email ,0
 Small room ground floor front room closed for a private party almost each night but the bar in the back room was open ,0
 Extremely small rooms Had a club room which was very small Staff were wonderful and put me in s different club room with more space and a better view Surprised that it is a 4 star hotel,0
 Tiny room have constantly to sign into wifi staff was rude in the beginning but became nicer and the sheets were not changed on our second day ,0
 rooms too small hardly any space to put your luggage especially if you take a single room,0
 Arrived to find there were boiler problems They tried to palm us off with another hotel which was inferior and had a walk up price 33 cheaper than what i had paid We have experienced this excuse multiple times in london so stood our ground Another room was conveniently found for us after not accepting their offer ,0
 Rooms are tiny,0
 My reservation was for two bed It was not available when we checked in It became available 3 days later Your front desk did a fantastic job that we decided to stay and I am glad we did ,0
 Lack of variety on the room service menu problems with key cards ,0
 Staff did not acknowledge you when coming and going Rooms very small Cannot move around furniture Bathroom was the size of a closet ,0
 My room was really small and had a large twin sized bed Didn t really have a restaurant breakfast only but that wasn t a problem as I found restaurants in the area to eat in ,0
 the room is not practical difficult to open the window stairs after the door to get in the room loss of space no cover on the bath so the water gets all around the bathroom hairdryer attached to drawer but not enough space to sit down on the chair am I supposed to steel the hairdryer there were small flies,0
 I would have liked breakfast to have been included in our stay We were offered it at a reduced rate but it would have been easier if it was included in the initial price as an option ,0
 Fire alarm kept going off plugs did not work one morning and staff did not know the jogging route mentioned in the hotel guest guide Rooms not serviced promptly and at our convenience,0
 Upon arrival we had to wait 10 minutes in the rain before someone could help us bring our 7 suitcases up the stairs into the reception area We had booked and paid for two of the same rooms as we were a group of 4 people One of our rooms were a downgrade from the other the rooms did not have the same appliances and one room had less space than the other We asked to be moved so we could both have the same room type and they said yes but never got round to it We had to wait over an hour for some ice buckets We found a thick long transparent plastic string in one of plates of breakfast and the restaurant staff actually looked into my hair and told me it was my hair because nobody in the kitchen has that hair We accidentally dropped salmon on our bed sheets and it smelt really bad so we asked if we could have a new duvet They gave us an uncovered single duvet for our double bed so when we asked for a double the night porter gave us the same dirty salmon duvet that we had put on the floor outside the room When we confronted him about it he shouted you cannot expect us to clean the bedding everyday My card was overcharged by 264 when I had checked out When I rang the hotel to let them know they said it s not their fault it s my bank When I called my bank they had given me 2 preauth codes proving the hotel were holding an extra 264 from my card and they had to fax my bank to allow the to cancel it The manager was unable to use his own fax machine so he sent me the fax letter through email and he made it my duty to get it faxed to a bank They are highly unprofessional and I will never ever stay at this hotel again It is appauling and disgusting ,0
 Size of the club room we were in Very small Luckily we travelled light ,0
 Very small room quite a challenge with two suitcases ,0
 Lots of ladies entering the hotel at random hours of the night and visiting various rooms I guess they must have been looking for something they lost ,0
 very small and by the way they gave me a club room I cannot imagine the sizes of the other rooms not very clean No room service Wifi is Zaft always disconnect Expensive The view of room is horrible,0
 4am smoke alarm causing everyone to attend the main foyer for an hour on Thursday 26 9 15 Also relatively small rooms and dining room staunch ions need removal ,0
 Cleanliness of rooms is challenging There was a bit of misunderstanding regarding on room upgrade but they managed it quickly ,0
 I LOVED EVERY MOMENT WELL DONE THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL WEEKEND IOANNIS BATSOS,0
 Reception staff poor upon arrival 6 staff behind reception seemingly dealing with 1 unhappy guest whilst we stood there finally someone came to check us in He demanded full payment straight away which is fine then told us our room was not ready this was 3pm check in is 2pm not a good start ,0
 The rooms are very small I booked a deluxe double room which is supposed to be bigger than a superior double room but it is difficult to imagine a room smaller than the one I had There was not enough space to get out of one side of the double bed The fire alarm went off at 4am not the hotel s fault but the following night I was kept awake by faulty door chimes which I couldn t stop from flashing green and red it was like trying to sleep in a night club ,0
 The wifi kept clicking off and there was only one shower gel but over all amazing,0
 The fire alarm went off at 4am It was chaos No one knew what to do Proper legal protocol was not followed Poor communication from the staff And not one word of an apology until we brought it up the next morning It spoilt out overnight stay The hotel could be fabulous Just staff and decor in some rooms let it down ,0
 My room was smelly and small hence beds are small for couples no space in the room to store my luggage the lady in the reception showed me other rooms which still small and we have to pay extra money for no value ,0
 Room was extremely small Despite being located on the first floor you feel like in the basement small unopenable window half bricked up You have to climb up the stairs to the bed the bathroom you cannot turn around Poor working wifi ,0
 Moved to another hotel at the eleventh hour situated on the ground floor of an annex next to the front door and lift I booked above ground Had to cross a road to go to breakfast ,0
 Room was small and the small window did not make the room very light ,0
 No facecloths a MUST for me Bath was too high to comfortably access shower for someone my age 72 No dining room music A BIT DISMAL,0
 We didn t have a bad experience,0
 The room was on the small side and the electronic maid service alarm kept buzzing in the night and at times in the morning ,0
 Windows didn t open We had to wait for our room although were offered a room on the lower ground floor instead,0
 I have updated my room to luxury room on booking website but I didn t got it And the breakfast was included and also they said you have to pay another 12 00 each for breakfast that s not fair I got the deal on booking com and when you arrive giving you different things and different deal,0
 The size of the room was very or should I say extremely small Hardly can move or have place to keep our laguge ,0
 Although there is a main elevator climbing up and down side stairs a bother with bags ,0
 Bathroom could have been a little larger showerscreen far too small ,0
 Deluxe double was a VERY small room could barely walk around the bed the ceilings were also low on 6th floor so when I was in shower I nearly hit my head on ceiling and I m only 5 foot 4 there were no special out of ordinary touches eg refrigeration guest robes iron or board in room there was a kettle and blow dryer it was clean however I would rate this a 3 star,0
 Read my comment above,0
 Unable to take a shower without soaking the tiny bathroom ,0
 Bar closes early for a Saturday Room was very small and although it was on 1st floor wasn t possible to open window Maids are very noisy in the morning,0
 Our room was hidden away in the basement but then it was one of the cheaper rooms ,0
 the 1st night was terrible we were arranged to a single room in the basement where our luggages couldn t be opened because of the limited spaces When we opened our room you need to walk up the stairs really terrible But we paid over 2000 dollars HOng kong Very unhappy and disappointed We complained and the manager upgraded us to club room which was acceptable for the rest of my stay ,0
 At first a staff gave me a room on first floor that i had to walk up many stairs and through a long corridor with my big heavy luggage Luckily another lady arranged a room on ground floor for me that made me feel more comfortable ,0
 Duvet too small for comfort told we could request for down pillows n bedding never came bed softer than most other places we ve stayed in london bed n bedding duvet pillows poor sub standard quality does not match to your hotel image Quite disappointing Bedroom though small is expected but configuration awkward opens bathroom door to block access to basin tight n squeezy even for one Really need to look into that ,0
 Rooms was very compact and didn t look four star which was a shame as the hotel itself was gorgeous and staff fantastic,0
 The room was just far too small to justify the price tag Not enough room for one let alone two suitcases The bathroom was more like a broom closet ,0
 No open windows Open door to accommodation to be greeted by five steps Also does not overlook hyde park as advertised,0
 The rooms are little small but i think for the money i paid I got the best value Good job Grand Royal hotel ,0
 On check in we was told we had to be relocated due to a maintenance issue The chap who dealt with this didn t do so in the best manner what upset us the most was the hotel option was not as good and cheaper than yours and when I said we will cancel and I would book elsewhere myself we was allowed to stay This ruined our start to our stay Marks on all bedroom walls and a toe nail clipping on bedroom Carpet small bedroom also ,0
 Very small rooms just fit a double bed with small staircase to the bathroom which was tiny I guess its because of the location which was excellent,0
 For the third time I was bumped out of the hotel upon arrival to another in the group The other hotel had a lift out of order the TV worked when the porter shook it and a large bathroom towel hook fell off the wall on my foot I am fed up with not being able to stay at the hotel I booked and I am meant to be on their partner frequent stay list What was worse while waiting for a taxi to go to other hotel they were booking other solo travellers in ,0
 Despite being upgraded to club the room was tiny and the window opened to the staff entrance which was noisy and busy with people smoking I asked to email the manager but no email was sent to me with his contact details ,0
 small rooms and expensive as far as quality and price is concerned,0
 the bedroom was small in spite of being told we were getting an upgrade it makes me wonder what the downgrade was like the bed itself was uncomfortable,0
 Towels were rough ,0
 The initial room we had was very small and we had to upgrade to a bigger one The mattress felt as if it was very old as it was extremely soft and the springs felt broken ,0
 The room was tiny Just enough space to walk around the bed There was a computer that guest could use but the printer s cartridge was depleted and it was not changed after a request to do so ,0
 However the rooms were compact and we were asked on arrival if we wanted to upgrade for free to a club room which was bigger than the room we had booked The club room turned out to be compact and the bath was tiny No view as it was on the lower ground floor Wouldn t stay here again ,0
 We were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working The alternate hotel is advertised as 4 star I don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other 4 star rated hotels I have stayed in It does not meet the high standard expected of a 4 star The bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average It was a real disappointment ,0
 The rooms were a little on the small side but adequate Can t say anything negative as it has great location clean rooms and friendly and helpful staff ,0
 Room was a little small for U S standards but I was expecting it to be much smaller based on previous reviews very comfortable size for a European hotel Pillows were a little hard and creeking floors from guests in room above were at times annoying but very minor No shower curtain but that s a European thing ,0
 Paid the supplement for the larger deluxe room but still very compact in size ,0

 Room size was so small we could not put any luggage on the floor which means completely unpacking and storing it or putting it under the bed The sitting area was really too small to eat at when we ordered room service Would have liked a view of the park as it was just a sliver Twice the hot water disappeared in the middle of a shower and twice someone was walking on the roof early in the am which woke us up We made our complaints know so hopefully resolved for next guest ,0
 Beds are very high in case you are travelling with very small children and they fall off the bed Other than that the hotel and staff were excellent ,0
 Not worthwhile noting negatives,0
 I didn t like that we only stayed for one night ,0
 Nil,0
 at 2 pm Our room not ready and the check in was too late around 4 pm and early check out 12 45 pm maximum It s too small in space and the break fast by order menu not an open buffet Massage room not prepared for that purpose And it s not too close to shopping center need a taxi ,0
 Pool area could do with some TLC Sauna was good though ,0

 Cannot think of anything other than the pool was a bit small but it is Central London so a pool was a bonus for our boys ,0
 Bit expensive ,0
 Too much knocking on my door in order to be at service sometimes less is the best ,0
 Some of the upholstery in the lounge needed replacing ,0
 Expensive extras valet laundry etc and room service taking cleaning things that were not always required to be taken cleaned,0
 Leaving I loved my stay there ,0
 Use of lounge for afternoon tea service tends to put you off using lounge for relaxation as all places are laid for tea service One can still use lounge but I felt I was intruding in some way ,0
 The lounge is used as a venue for afternoon tea so cannot be used just to relax and read etc One can use the bar or conservatory but these are not as comfortable as lounge ,0
 Room far too small,0
 Price too high for facilities and room size Low ceiling due to the stairs at the entrance of the room Limited options for an English breakfast Besides the 5 types of meals which I skipped for a scrambled egg option no other foods were available expected more fruits and drinks ,0

 too expensive for a regular treat shame,0
 old,0
 Room was a little small for a baby cot But kind of expected this in London ,0
 We were there on Friday night came back to the hotel at about 9pm thinking we would like a quiet drink But there was very loud so called jazz being played in the only sitting area There was another bar area but we were told we could not use it so the only place was our room for such a large hotel there really should be somewhere to sit in comfort ,0
 The bathroom was small and the floor got wet when using the shower as there was no step or tray to contain the water Made it slippery to use the toilet Glass door got in the way of the entrance the spa facilities were poor and not very clean Signage was lacking in the hotel made it difficult to find out where to go for the spa breakfast bar etc unless you asked staff,0
 The hotel was a bit further from Kings Cross than expected There was no draught lager available on Saturday night,0
 Noisy aircon unable to open windows unable to use stairs and had to use lift,0
 Could not sleep all night as the people next to us were screaming and talking very loudly The room had a conjoining door this may have made it worse Tried earplugs and knocking on the door but it didn t help The gym facilities were falling apart and very small ,0
 Big negative for me was the fact that the windows could nt open so there s no fresh air in the rooms the use of air conditioning for air resulted in me getting a really bad chest infection The pay on demand TV system did not work for our entire stay and no proper effort was made to try and rectify it,0
 Air conditioning Breakfast trays were not removed when room was cleaned on one day I had to ring 3 times and ask for someone to take the tray away ,0
 The lifts are shaky for anyone nervous of these things the room got stuffy do needed aircon all night although weather unusually humid ,0
 Having to pay for the use of the pool when i am a staying at the hotel terrible Having to wait a long time to check in and out very poor and slow service,0
 After waiting for 2 hours over our check in time I finally visited the front desk after watching numerous older couples successfully getting a room key and after explaining that I was told to wait for a room and then watching other go through miraculously a room became available I felt throughly discriminated against because we was a younger couple Then after walking around London all day we wanted to order room service after 3 trips to the reception and 1 broken phone we finally got 2 lots of fish and chips I never usually complain and this may seem like mediocre complaints but when it s your Fianc s birthday you just want everything to be perfect Highly disappointed ,0
 Breakfast can be very busy try to avoid the rush after 9am The hotel has three lifts for the whole hotel and the stairs were closed for renovation can take a while to get anywhere during the very sumner season The London underground is a good 15 20 minutes walk from the hotel ,0
 My car was broken into in the hotel car park Staff not in the slightest bit interested Had to drive home on seats of glass the day of sightseeing in London abandoned,0
 Location you really need a vehicle it s a 15 minute walk to the nearest tube station ,0
 It s 15 minutes at least from metro King s cross or Russel station Which is fine if you plan to stay out all day but it s a bit of a walk For some reason the alarm rang in the room the last day for 10 minutes and stopped Hard way to wake up but overall everything was great ,0
 Booking in and out was great for me my friends could have had slightly more friendly speedy service on reception Long wait for lifts often very crowded,0
 Location bit far from U G station you may need 15 min walk no attractions around the hotel ,0
 Since being refurbished and changed from a Holiday Inn to Crowne Plaza it seems what were previously 2 good sized rooms have now been made into 3 cramped rooms Not enough floor space to put your suitcase without having to manouevre around it all the time Bed was lumpy and felt like springs were coming through Probably the worst bathroom design I have ever seen The elevated shower tray has a lip of around maybe 3 mm and the shower head is positioned half behind the glass shower screen The end result is that everything gets soaking wet floor toilet toilet paper absolutely everything because it is all so close together in the small bathroom My shower flooded everything and passed through into the bedroom carpets and as a result had to change rooms staff were very helpful with this but really not the point Breakfast is a standard buffet type priced at an astonishing 18 pounds per head if you buy in advance then you get vouchers and the price is discounted to 15 pounds I find it hard to believe that most people could eat 18 pounds worth of breakfast if costed at true value NOT GOOD VALUE AT ALL and at times it seemed that certain items such as sausages were carry over from the previous day On arrival I was told that since changing to Crown Plaza then the free WIFI no longer requires login or password What they didnt point out was that the WIFI is now unsecured and as such my businness and personal applications on laptop tablet and phone would not permit me to connect kind of frustrating when you are travelling on business and WIFI is important Although I didnt see it my nose told me that there must be a swimming pool possibly at basement level Reception smells strongly of chlorine Location at best is OK but not great with a good 10 15 minutes walk to nearest tube or main station and the area certainly isnt trendy or smart and to get anywheer of interest etc involves a decent hike on foot tube etc ,0
 The only thing we said was that upon arrival to your room you get a free bottle of water and a small supply of tea coffee making facilities This is good if you re only staying one night but we stayed for 2 and would have appreciated the extra supplies ,0
 The room was smelly when we first checked in The AC was not working properly so at night I was sweating We turned the temperature to strongest fan and lowest temperature but still not much cool air It was a beating The distance to the tube stations were not that close but we discovered a bus number 63 that would shuttle us from King s cross to the hotel so we just budgeted extra 15 minutes to our trips to account for bus travel time ,0
 The room was not ready when I arrived I was told to come back at 2 00pm which I did I then had to queue again this time for 20 minutes and it still was not ready ,0
 Breakfast was fine but the staff that were on at breakfast didn t approach my table so made it a little difficult to grab somebody s attention when I had a question but it was perfectly adequate and very nice food ,0
 The only thing I would say that would make the hotel better would be that there doesn t appear to be any buggy or wheelchair access from the lower lobby reception area up to the Belgio and breakfast restaurants,0
 The Leisure facilities at the hotel were not well sign posted or advertised in your room ,0
 everything was perfect ,0
 Service was atrocious Initially I was told my room had been double booked so I had no where to stay Then I was asked if it was ok to share a room with a total stranger Staff were useless couldn t even get a tea bag brought up to my room ,0
 I did not like Room 117 where after getting out of the lift I had to lug my case down stairs in the hall I strongly resent having to pay for swimming pool in the hotel ,0
 The hotel has gone through a refurbishment and changed from a holiday Inn to Crowne Plaza Previously rooms were a good size and although a little tired were relatively comfortable Now rooms have been made smaller presumably to increase number of rooms overall and are too small not even enough space to leave your suitcase somewhere without it getting in the way and overall feels claustraphobic Windows dont open so you wake desperately needing fresh air Beds are lumpy and it feels like you can feel the springs Probably the worst designed bathroom I have ever seen shower tray is elevated and has a rim of about 3mm The shower heads are positioned so that you can barely stand behind the glass shower screen and the end result is that a lake is created on the bathroom floor and the spray from the water soaks everything from the bath mat to toilet tissue I had an issue with my bathroom whereby water was seeping under the walls and created pools in the bedroom carpet Staff were very helpful in this instance but I had to change rooms and was upgraded to a club room which was a better size but same bathroom etc and mini bar was locked and inaccesible the hotel has also changed its WIFI now no password needed but the connection is not a secure one this meant that my business laptop and applications would not permit me to connect same with some personal apps so as a business traveller it meant I couldnt work buffet breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly 18 pounds If you buy vouchers in advance you get 3 pounds discount but even then it is expensive and overpriced Room rates very variable depending on which night stayed but range from around 155 to 285 pounds per night which is high It may be london but its not the west end nor the most glamorous of areas I beieve there is a pool in the basement but as a result the whole of reception area smell strongly of chlorine,0
 We didn t have time to take advantage of pool as we had plans with friends It took 1 5 hrs in an uber to get to Gatwick airport,0
 Having to pay as I went the computers were down ,0
 Very slow reception staff not very welcoming considering a 4 star hotel more a free for all to get seen and staff do not listen to customers bad to see them smoking in uniform at side of restaurant was ok once there but expect 15 20min walk if your good at walking to nearest tube station really bad for location ,0
 Although it s only 3 50 you have to pay extra to use the gym,0
 it was a long walk from Kings cross station with cases over rough footpaths ,0
 Location was a little further from Kings Cross station than hoped for 10 mins walk but other than that all good ,0
 No information in room on the hotel facilities ,0
 The room was way too warm which made it difficult to sleep at night ,0
 Business men in particular were assured more than casually dressed folk soaked from the sudden torrential rain while queuing to check in manually as systems were down that Friday ,0
 I ate at the Belgo restaurant one evening The food was only just warm The waiter did not offer any condiments and I could not get his attention again I ended up leaving most of the food as it was too dry Some of the attention in the bathroom could have been better I moved to another room where the toilet was coming away from the wall but accepted this since I didn t want to be next to the lift The mini bars are empty meaning not even being able to have any bottled water late evening or early morning Two times I went to the fitness and spa and not all facilities were possible due to cleaning These could be done out of hours but at least cleansiness maintenance was paramount The only complaint there is that they should visit the sauna there was wood worms by the door coming from the wood frames ,0
 Charge to use the pool gym Location a bit weird about a 15 min walk from Kings Cross,0
 It s far from a big supermarket But store in front was good to get something ,0
 We booked a room with 2 double beds but there was not one available and so we were given a standard double room The guests in the next room were very loud and partied with doors banging until 4am The air conditioning was noisy making a rattling noise all the time which seemed to become more noticeable when you tried to sleep The room was not overly clean and the remote for the TV seemed to be mood dependent when it wanted to work At breakfast the food was lovely but the dining room was a mess tables were not cleared there was cutlery missing from the table no one offered tea or coffee at the table or directed you where to find anything There was no printed information about the hotel or its facilities in the room we did not even know it had a pool or spa ,0
 Parents allowing their children to dive in the pool,0
 See above,0
 The bathroom was designed with looks in mind but not practicality The oversized sink undersized tap shower without glass etc i think an art major designed this with no practicality in sight D,0
 We had complaints of noise when we had music from a small Bluetooth speaker on a Friday night as we were getting ready to go out for dinner Ridiculous Also you have to PAY to use the poor or gym I don t know of any hotel that requires that ,0
 The hotel was a 15 minute walk from Kings Cross station With a suitcase this was a nightmare Ended up spending more money on taxi fare and buses Hotel staff in reception were not very pleasant and very abrupt Never smiled and almost seemed irritated with me asking questions Main toilets in the hotel were on level 1 in a hotel room as they were having a refurbishment When arriving at the hotel in the morning I couldnt check in until 2pm and needed the toilet What they didnt tell you was you needed a pass and anyone could just walk in Very strange and I was not advised of any of this upon checking in Overall very disorganised and customer service not great ,0
 I only know that they charge us to use the pool and gym Their website is deceiving giving the impression that like most hotels those facilities are available to guests free of charge The location is also a bit far from the closet tube station Though the name carries King s Cross it is like 10 mins walk from the King s Cross station And since King s Cross is a big station it would take 15 20 mins from hotel door to platform ,0
 Housekeeping cleaning of the room If you don t leave money housekeeping will not leave shampoo toilet paper and water Location of hotel is great it s the real center of London Breakfast is good but a bit expensive ,0
 had to pay extra to use spa facilities and wasn t part of the hotel as expected you had to go out of the hotel and into the cellar suprising after staying at other crown plaza hotels i emailed the hotel and got no reply,0
 Few small details could have been better tv remote didn t work and there was no welcome note or hotel details booklet,0
 There was a long wait for check in however believe it was due to the BA cancellations so understand ,0
 There is an additional charge for using the leisure facilities Reception staff discourteous at times ,0
 Room service was very weird The waiter barged into the room without being asked to creating a very awkward situation He also didn t carry a card payment terminal ,0
 Not much ,0
 Location far from everything Impossible to open the windows in the room Lavatories in works at the lobby,0
 No computer for guests although I think there will be one in the future Doorway to bathroom was narrow and the door had a tall handle so it was awkward getting in and out of the bathroom Very little space between bed and desk ,0
 There are still some minor surface issues like the door leading to my room having had its handle removed looked messy but I understand the hotel is in process of transformation ,0
 The waitress staff at breakfast could have been more attentative I e asking if we required tea or coffee when being seated instead of us having to ask for it Also on arrival at the hotel we were told that there was no booking for us Yet I clearly had a confirmation email from booking com telling me that It was booked This caused us some anguish after a 3 hour journey The receptionist eventually sorted us out after a 30 minute wait ,0
 no complaints everything was fine ,0
 Car park spaces were ridiculously small scratched our 16 plate Mercedes due to one of your staff misguiding us in 20 for car park over night which is shocking Breakfast was vile and everything was hard and cold Ladies toilets were in the basement 2 floors from reception and was like a building site health and safety Oh and only 8 spaces in the car park,0
 No complaints ,0
 I was asked was there a reason for the trip I said it was for my daughter in law and son s birthdays also there wedding annervesary which was all in that week of booking I had been informed they would have a bottle of wine waiting for them nil given ,0
 the room was very small for the price When using the shower it soaked the bathroom floor The hot food wasn t so hot and was a little disappointing My room was not cleaned nor new towels provided despite being out of the hotel for 11 1 2 hours Not the service I expect for the price The staff were apologetic but not remotely sincere about it ,0
 Trying to order room service took over 40 minutes a number of calls to reception that did not finish the call before putting the phone down and the kitchen restaurant not answering the phones Also the worst part was the fact that all the systems were down so i was unable to get a receipt on booking in they tried applying a 2nd charge then on checking out still unable to get a receipt and still today i have been unsuccessful in gaining a receipt meaning i shall not be able to claim on my expenses for the accommodation despite a number of messages to the hotel and calls i still have not got a receipt very disappointing and would recommend booking com removing them ,0
 Reception and concierge handled by trainees IT system broke down a few days before and not fixed ,0
 Bellboy was extremely rude when we asked to store our luggage Asked us to drag our bags across the lobby just to drag them back then made us feel as if we were inconveniencing him when that s his job For 150 a night it s the least we expect ,0
 The gym was horrendous I paid 3 to use a few 8kg dumbbells It shouldn t list that they even have a gym Value for money is terrible to be fair when compared to others in the area ,0
 The view and no porters to help with luggage ,0
 The cooked breakfast was practically cold This was on both mornings so was not a one off case We would have been better off going room only and eating out The staff were not helpful on arrival this was our first time here and we had no idea where to find anything It would have been helpful if they had asked if we had been here before and if not they should have a taken the time to tell us where things were Apparently there is a bar somewhere Reception staff looked miserable and unapproachable All in all not a very friendly hotel ,0
 Being very picky but perhaps a mirror on the wall near to the hairdryer ,0
 Wifi was not accessible in our room at all ,0
 When I came back to the hotel almost 4 30pm my room wasn t made up I found this a bit annoying as I had been out and about since 8 00am and had to go to the lounge to wait until the room was ready While at the lounge I waited what seemed to be an interminable length to order a drink Eventually a manager came along spotted me and immediately got a floor staff member to take an order which was delivered promptly However when it came to paying for the drink I found it difficult to find any floor staff to pay and eventually went to the bar to pay for the drink The chairs in the lounge were a bit grubby in contrast to the room furnishings ,0
 I had to move to another hotel during the week end because the fare was too expansive but this is London ,0
 Charge for pool I only have cereals for breakfast told receptionist this and there was no mention of a small breakfast when I said I didn t want to pay 14 95 for cereals toast and drink ,0
 After paying a lot you have to pay to go for a swim or to the gym The bath shower were a bit high and therefore getting into the shower is a struggle for small people,0
 The hot water for the bath never achieved anywhere near 40 degrees The room was very warm even though the AC was turned down to it s lowest setting and I overheard another guest complaining about this at checkout When I went to open the room door from the inside I happened to look up and there was a gap between the ceiling and the door frame of about 1 2 a foot filled with wires which was a bit disconcerting On checkout I was asked to wait while they checked my room for damages Yup While they checked my room for damages That is literally what the receptionist told me I told her I was very insulted and she said I m sorry and then shrugged The shrug was the last straw I m not sure the British are very good with shrugs So I took it to the Manager who was very receptive and listened carefully and promised to report the woman to her Manager I wouldn t return again I ve had these problems with 4 star hotels before It s always better to go high or modest Not somewhere that is trying too hard to live off the parent companies name ,0
 It was advertised with a spa but did not mention it was run separately from the hotel and had an extra cost to use the facilities Very disappointed with the spa hot tub was out of order swimming pool so small could not swim and member of leisure staff not helpful ,0
 Restaurant was on the expensive side I would prefer to give a tip than it be added to my bill Shame about the hot tub being out of order ,0
 It was a little expensive for the food provided as after a certain time there was only sandwiches and crisps even though the menu said fries ,0
 The bed,0
 Drinks in the bar were very expensive so we probably won t use the bar again,0
 The shower needs a longer door or a supplemental curtain ,0
 Lacks character and charm bar area is nice and breakfasts very good They charge you to use the leisure facilities even if you are a guest ,0
 Location a bit too far out which we didn t really understand when booking our fault bit would have hoped for a nearer tube stop The bed and pillows were really uncomfortable and we had a bad nights sleep The queue for The check in was also really long longer than we have ever seen at a hotel at check in time The staff were also quite aloof and unfriendly compared to other hotels we have stayed in ,0
 When we first went into our room there was no kettle This was reported to reception at once as we would have liked a hot drink on our arrival I phone reception an hour later still no kettle At 6 00pm we decided to go out for a walk and to have a hot drink else where On the way out complained again about the kettle On our arrival back at the hotel at 10 00pm kettle was in our room ,0
 None ,0
 The room size for the price we paid Very cramped Not enough cupboard space We stayed there a week ,0
 They charged us 3 50 pounds to use the pool and fitness room the rooms are super small and there was no wifi for the first 2 days of our stay and when they did get wifi the connection was super slow I would not stay at a crown plaza again ,0
 Pull out sofa bed wasn t made up on the first night like we re were advised but as I had a long day and the fact i was ill and already sleeping my auntie who was sleeping on the bed didn t want to call for someone to make the bed so slept with out and quilt or pillow the following night the bed was made up,0
 Staff were not great We asked for our luggage to be picked up and said there will be someone there straight away I waited 20 mins before calling again and they then told me they were too busy to collect them I had 4 suitcases ,0
 We had heavy luggage and the walking distance was further than had anticipated Easy route by taxi or bus ,0
 we rang to reception to find out about the spa to be told it was in the basement we then had to call at reception to ask again as the lift didn t go to the basement due to refurb work that was all fine except it gave the reception staff two opportunities to tell us we needed to pay to use the facilities which would have saved my hubby from having to go right back to the room for money Jacuzzi then not working when we got in there Did think the spa let the hotel down ,0
 Overall this choice of hotel was disappointing personally Location was not as convenient as expected and despite King s Cross being included in the hotel s name it was not that close to the station being about 10 GBP taxi fare away ,0
 On arrival the Receptionist spoke so quickly that we couldn t understand We were disappointed to find out we had to pay for the pool this was not clear on the website The jacuzzi wasn t even working and the pool was smaller than it looked on website I chose the hotel based on the photos of the pool so very disappointing The bedroom but especially the breakfast restaurant was uncomfortably warm More air needed in there ,0
 The pool was ice cold due to breakdown or maintenance but obviously couldnt be helped ,0
 Charge of 3 50 per visit to swimming pool VERY poor show Belgo restaurant evening meal too small staff unable to increase portion size indicating to me it s all out of a packet ,0
 I made sure it had parking but it really didn t and they charged 20 pounds for parking which they failed to inform I also booked in for breakfast it s was 14 95 and they charged me 20 and then had to go up to the room 3 times before the access card actually worked The quality of food from room Service was poor and not cheap ,0
 There were smell of cigarettes in the room and for me as non smoker it wasn t nice I felt like being in ashtray ,0
 The room was way too hot even with air con on not able to open windows Had to pay for pool facilities which was not stated on the website Not cool Water in the bath didn t get very hot ,0
 Limited and expensive overnight parking expensive bar and the receptionist who didn t ask for the registration of our car which could have resulted in us being charged 100 had we not enquired later ,0
 Too bad it is not closer to St Pancras or near a tube station You have to walk at least 15min to get to a station or st Pancras ,0
 The hotel was under refurbishment and some facilities were not available The closest underground station is Kings Cross station and it takes around 15 minutes walking,0
 Had to squash against the wall whilst showering to stop the shower flooding the bathroom floor No refund available when we accidentally booked the wrong dates through the online booking system so we had to pay twice ,0
 difficult to put plug in bath due to fixed shower screen also the hot water not very hot for bath and shower yet hand basin hot water very hot,0
 I thought I d booked the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury but got Holiday Inn Kings Cross Bloomsbury although it is in fact a Crown Plaza hotel It was a good 10 mins walk away from where I wanted to stay I ll book hotel direct next time ,0
 Gym charge not made clear but see above ,0
 Would have liked tea and coffee access in room not only via room service to pay another 3 50 charge for it as well also be nice if leisure centre access included as free to residents not 3 50 extra,0
 Breakfast was okay there s a good selection of food but eggs weren t cooked enough and black pudding was overdone Pool closes to children at 18 30hrs think this should be later as we didn t get the chance to use it and kids were upset ,0
 The rain shower was wonky so when turned on water sprayed everywhere When I adjusted the head of the shower the dirt that was on top of it was disgusting The staff where friendly but we had to wait a long time for bags to be put into storage ,0
 The booking for a smoking room was not reflected in my initial room assignment Luckily they had one remaining If this is your preference you may wish to call ahead to make sure the room type you reserved is honored at check in Otherwise a pleasant stay ,0
 The air con didn t work in the bedroom We were not able to open the window so extremely hot We only had one robe in a double room ,0
 I booked a smoking room and but was told there was no smoking room Booking com must make sure it is only available to book when there is availability,0
 one member of staff was rude We booked a smoking room with a queen bed and bath We were given a non smoking room smaller bed and no bath When we contacted staff about this they came across rude and didn t accommodate us the room we paid for We expected the room we paid for and that s what we should have got ,0
 The hotel is situated a good 15 minute walk to the closet tube station so if you plan to get around London via public transport you ll need to factor in a fair bit of walking,0
 Room was warm too warm in fact a day air con wasn t particularly good Selection of TV also wasn t great if your not into sport Good that sky sports was included but general channel selection was only adequate and movies were pay per view Additionally the pool wasn t inclusive and should have been for this level of hotel although not expensive ,0
 Got extremely warm aircon seemed to have little effect exacerbated by the windows unable to open at all ,0
 Only complaint is that the room kettle should be inspected more often for calcification and cleanliness,0
 The room while recently renovated and is very comfy has a very bad bathroom design The glass screen only extends half way so there is no way that the bathroom floor will be dry when you shower as the water will definitely splash there ,0
 There aren t any restaurants nearby you have to take a bus to get to the main part of London However it s only a 10min bus journey ,0
 Not a dislike necessarily but we found the tea coffee making facilities when we were checking out they are in a drawer This keeps the room neat and tidy but we completely missed them ,0
 The breakfast time was extremely busy and they constantly ran out of items so we had to keep asking hence having to constantly wait until they replenished this really was rather annoying Also i would suggest bringing pots of coffee tea to the table for the guests so the guests don t have to get up constantly Also the location is a lot further from a tube station than initially thought approximately 15 min walk so we had to Uber quite a bit on an evening where typically we would use the tube ,0
 After arriving after a long journey a member of staff woman was giving us weird looks as if we were not welcomed there We were very tired and got asked a lot of u reasonable questions and got asked for two ID cards One of the keys wasn t working either ,0
 We were told we were being upgraded to an executive room and in the same sentence we were told that the room was not very good but hey it s an upgrade We didn t understand why we were being upgraded to a smaller room Surely that s a downgrade The bottles of water and chocolate and other little touches were nice but was not worth the upgrade ,0
 It was further away from kings cross station than implied I picked the hotel on the basis I needed to be on an early train and that wasn t ideal,0
 The walls had holes carpets look worn out and paint on walls wasn t finished Needs refurbishment ,0
 Not a good location with 2 young kids A long way to nearest tube station they say 10 mins but it s 15 A lot of bus hopping done It s now Crown Plaza group not Holiday Inn Swimming pool freezing cold costs extra each day Room didn t have enough bath towels for all of us or tea making facilities biscuits TV problems apparently just this weekend really annoying ,0
 The hotel rebranded to crown plaza the day I booked and it took over an hour to find walking late at night in the rain THE HOTEL HAS NOW RED EXTERIOR AND CROWNE PLAZA SIGNAGE NOT GREEN AND WHITE HOLIDAY INN NO ONE AT THE HOTEL OR BOOKING COM THOUGHT TO TELL THOSE WHO HAD BOOKED THAT THE HOTEL HAD CHNAGED NAME AND BRAND THESE IDIOTS ARE STILL CALLING IT HOLIDAY INN FOR GODS SAKE IT EVENTUALLY COST ME 20 QUID IN TAXIS AND GOING TO THE HOLIDAY INN BLOOMSBURY TO FIND IT THE HOTEL IS THE CROWNE PLAZA KINGS CROSS CHANGE THE BLOODY NAME FOR GODS SAKE AND TELL YOUR CLIENTS BOOKERS BEWARE THAT SAID THE REBRAND AND MAKE OVER MAKES THIS A REAL PREMIUM HOTEL NOT AT ALL LIKE HOLIDAY INNS THE MAKEOVER IS NOT 100 COMPLET BUT PRICES REFELCET THIS AND RIGHT NOW ITS GOOD VLAUE ,0
 Staff knocking on the door and male staff entering without warning Plus we asked for extra towels but they didn t come We asked for a refund on our room but not sure if we got that though the assistant manager was sympathetic ,0
 The bar only had lagers and ciders no good if you drink Guinness Breakfast could be better had to wait for bacon My wife said that some of hers was cold ,0
 Changing from HI to Crowne Plaza not sure on room allocations upgraded room was 2 double beds felt small Breakfast on Sunday was chaos run out of lots of things staff not effective slow,0
 Wanted continental breakfast but the the meat cheese looked dried out the pastrys didn t taste fresh ,0
 Most hotel kitchens seem to be unable to cook bacon properly This was no exception Lack of a public lounge area and no toilets near bar oR restaurant Toilets where available in the cold basement below reception but where very poor ,0
 The restaurant staff were shockingly slow and rude No idea of customer service and no response from management when complaining Very expensive menu as well This with rude staff who do not have a good understanding of english is very poor ,0
 Perhaps a better design in the bathroom shower was next to the window so water went all over the blind Road noise was intrusive better double glazing possibly ,0
 The only minor minus was 15 minutes walk to the nearest underground station But still not something big really ,0
 Restaurant bar didn t have any dry white wine other than the house which was mediocre at best Every option I asked for they were out Only one salad option no soup but I could have walked to plenty of other places in the area now wished I had Room was very warm and stuffy on arrival the room thermostat had a dial but only one temperature came out hot I don t like to sleep in a warm room so had very little sleep The point of me staying over night was to be well rested for an important meeting When I booked I asked for a fan as this is sadly the case with many hotels but had to request after check in but made little difference to the room as not fresh air to circulate and already hot on arrival I will not be using this hotel again ,0
 The layout of the room specifically that the desk chair backs right into the bed making it awkward to sit or stand and if there had been a guest with me impossible to navigate from the sitting area to the door or bathroom Kind of an odd thing to do ,0
 Wellness section is for extra price maybe just the only bad news for bookers but no more complaining ,0
 I had to pay for the gym My room service was due in 15 minutes and took 50 The salad I ordered was covered in olives despite no mention on the menu The towels were thin and tiny the fan in the bathroom was noisy and I was unable to turn it off Terrible night I will not be back,0
 Shower flooded the bathroom bad design Remote took 9 presses to get a button to work One room key didn t work long queue at reception to get it changed Toilets a long way from breakfast Bread at breakfast was stale,0
 I was a little disappointed that the sauna was so small and I was a little alarmed about the light floating in the pool that had come loose I reported but the staff were fully aware and was in the process of getting it sorted out And although my room was lovely and clean I did see a pair of pliers that were left on the floor by the lamp that I luckily avoided stepping on as it was almost hidden by the curtain I also ordered breakfast to my room where some of the food items were cold so that was a little disappointing too but overall I had a pleasant stay ,0
 Would have liked a wider menu in restaurant Light bites and sandwiches at lunch time ,0
 There were a small set of stairs between the lifts and the room may sound picky but with a big heavy case it was a real pain ,0
 Lifts were very slow and over crowded we had to wait for 4 lifts before we could get in one There weren t clear signs to the stairs which we would have taken instead Building work happening in the hotel which we were not aware of prior to stay and the hotel bar area was unstaffed when we got back for a nightcap at 10pm,0
 Not the best view,0
 The walls are paper thin Terrible nights sleep Hours of coughing and snoring from the bedroom next door Lots of noise from the corridor ,0
 No information in room about facilities meal times etc Charge of 3 50 for use of swimming pool for residents is not acceptable ,0
 Breakfast room very dated Tea coffee out of flasks No poached or fried eggs Fruit selection poor fan in our bathroom on all night asked for handyman to take a look told no one available consequently didn t sleep much first night but second slept like a log Quite location,0
 Parking I phoned to ask about parking to be told that there were 20 spaces but could not be reserved and were only available on a first come first served basis However when we arri ved no spaces available but two spaces had clearly been reserved NCP parking 10 mins away cost 28 for 24 hours,0
 Would have been good to be made aware of the pool,0
 The food served in hotel was not the greatest the dining room was also not ideal but we appreciate this may be due to renovations,0
 In my opinion the breakfast could have been better choice was limited such as fried eggs not being available Food was good quality Only complaint would be the choice ,0
 the room was very small the bed too we go 1 towel everyday I had to call with my telephone as the phone in the room did not work for new towels every day ,0
 The only downside was our hotel room had only a shower and no bath ,0
 The restaurant and bar area seemed a bit depressing e g no windows and too crowded The location is slightly inconvenient but overall we got a fair deal ,0
 Wanted to use gym but was closed ,0
 The hash browns felt overly reheated soft instead of crisp ,0
 10 mins swift walk to nearest tube station Russell Square ,0
 Coffee for breakfast could be better the breakfast becomes repetitive after 2 days over 10 mins walk to the nearest subway,0
 coffee and bacon at breakfast poor Paid parking at 20 pounds was high should be split into shorter time periods,0
 Most people traveling on business travel really early to make 8am meetings London being a metropolitan you d think people could book in at 9am at least luckily for me I could freshen up and get to court by 9am your staff from reception to pool breakfast and room service were all friendly and professional Honestly was a pleasure being in the Hotel ,0
 layout in lobby area was poor sliding doors were not open twice bar downstairs was not in keeping with the standard in the rest of the hotel,0
 Due to renovations there were only lifts to get to the rooms not good for someone who is claustrophobic The one we got into stopped as it did not go to our floor The Prosecco ordered to the room as a surprise for my husband s birthday was not there No hot water in hotel the following morning ,0
 Don t charge 5 to use the lame gym in the basement horrible And I am a Holiday Inn Rewards member So stupid from a business standpoint ,0
 No where to put 1 let alone 2 suitcases except floor or lounge Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss Cups and glasses not always cleaned replaced and carpet not vacuumed once in 4 days The restaurant was terrible We were made to feel belittled because we didn t have a booking webpage just says come and join us no mention of need to book when we could see spare tables For what we received the food was overpriced Small portions and my salmon Caesar salad was just a hot piece of salmon dumped onto lettuce with the barest hint of dressing croutons or parmesan cheese quite tasteless ,0
 Staff were not very friendly and seemed like the guests were a irritant that interfered with what they were doing ,0
 Empty area without any big chances for good meals Breakfast ok but not available some foods for example fried eggs ,0
 WiFi issues on the 1st floor although they were solved thanks to great customer service ,0
 When we arrived we walked up to the gentleman at the first desk pod and said we d like to check in he pointed towards 3 identical pods to his right and said reception There was no way to know which one he meant no signage and at that moment no one behind any of them We then saw a woman return to one so went to her and checked in The room was small and badly laid out could barely walk between desk and bed and could barely pull out chair enough to sit down The floor of the bathroom floods when shower used these are new rooms Food was served in the basement as temporary measure while refurbishing badly photocopied menus and ill tempered staff we left and found somewhere local to eat though quite tired ,0
 sound proofing could be improved could hear muffled sound of neighbour ladies laughing and speaking Air cond is also too noisy Could also hear water passing through pipes as neighbouring taps were turned on and off ,0
 The fire alarm went off several times during the night The hotel is quite a walk from King s Cross St Pancras station ,0
 I thought the use of the gym and pool was included in the price but it wasn t you had to pay extra ,0
 Breakfast was average porridge and bananas lacking no marmite or kippers in evidence rolls and croissants slightly stale But staff most helpful especially as we had a three year old child with us ,0
 No hot water endless queues to get breakfast I think we must have caught the hotel on a bad weekend ,0
 Just wish I could ve stayed longer ,0
 Will be better when all work is finished ,0
 It s a little sketchy from the hotel to kings cross,0
 The main elevator was not working so plenty of times we had to go up to the 5th floor using the stairs ,0
 Water and drink in fridge I booked for one double bed they placed me in room with two single beds,0
 The Wifi signal was intermittent but we just found comfy seats in the basement lobby where it was stronger there we could plan our day so it really wasn t an issue ,0
 Late night major electrical fault in several rooms on my floor causing blue flames loud crackling noise at the wall socket in use and wrecking my device charger Night staff were helpful in changing my room but I didn t feel safe and got very little sleep Refund for the cost of a replacement charger the following morning was grudging ,0
 The room hot as the air con is weak and wimpy ,0
 The noise all night was a joke I stayed with a 9 year and 3 year old the night before Disney they never got sleep with the noise at 6 we gave up and got dressed and showered,0
 The hotel is being renovated large areas are closed off and there is the associated noise and dirt associated with construction work The pool fitness area is only available at an extra cost and was quite dirty with evidence of a large amount work still needed The lifts were hopeless we stayed on the top floor and only 2 of the 3 went to all floor which meant getting from the Lobby to the room could take 10 minutes The fire alarm was broken and sounded a number of times in the night ruining any hope of a restless night ,0
 Standard so much lower than a 4 Croissants were cheap imitations Place was being renovated Alarm system went off 10 times between 2am and 8am My 4 star room had an adjoining door with an inch gap st the bottom I could hear our neighbours every words Wifi crap and cleaners didn t service room properly Rubbish was not cleared bed wasn t made properly ,0
 The queues to get in the breakfast room were large Once in there we had to queue again for hot food By the time we had waited for toast and eggs the rest of the food was cold More kitchen staff needed,0
 The only very slight issue was no room information left in my room but was ther within 10 minsbof reporting it awesome ,0
 Breakfast was quite stressful due to the long lines waiting I understand that this was due to the refurbishment and we were pre warned ,0
 Bed was small bathroom flooded from shower woken up at 7 00 by hoovering and drilling and banging Staff were rude in terms of didn t tell us anything like where the lifts were or when check out was No book in room to tell us information ,0
 Checked in with family around 7 30pm Given room keys for a 1st floor room Upon entering room there was no sofa bed for kids Had to go back to reception and queue again to be seen where I was first advised that I had not booked family room Upon showing the booking ref where it did show the family room was booked we were given a new room on 7th floor Upon moving from the 1st floor to the 7th floor the keys didn t open the door so had to leave the family in the corridor go back to reception again queue again to get new keys Upon entry to the room the sofa bed was not made up so had to wait for house keeping to arrive to make up The whole check in period from first entering reception to actually getting everything sorted in the room approx 40mins which isn t good at the end of a long day when you have tired kids After all this turned on the TV and the remote control didn t work At this point gave up and went to sleep P S You have to pay extra to use the hotels own services i e swimming pool ,0
 Perhaps bigger lifts but not an issue at all ,0
 No info on website regarding building work luckily not at hotel during day but if I had I would have been annoyed Distance to nearest tube station was about a mile too far time in London is too precious ,0
 As there was renovations which didn t bother us the water supply got cut off a few times which I would have liked warning with a phone call from reception to inform us and give us a time frame about it ,0
 Basement not refurbished yet but if it matches the rest of the building it will be great Signage to find the bar and other facilities was hard to find ,0
 The building was still to be completed following an obvious refurb The lifts were extremely slow waited almost 10 minutes before taking the stairs which were clearly being used to move tools and materials and therefor looked like a tradesmans stairwell ,0
 The layout of the breakfast was a bit strange cereals would have been better with the fruit and cheese instead of next to the hot food,0
 I arrived very late in the evening and had a very early start and the check in staff were extremely slow despite no other customer being around The floor was a no smoking floor but the whole floor and corridor stank of cigarette smoke The location is shocking Kings Cross I may as well call any wherein the M25 near Kings Cross This hotel is situated in a dodgy poorly lit area not that near to the station As a female sole traveller it felt very unsafe ,0
 Work still being done in the hotel and inadequacy of temporary signage makes it difficult to find your way around This isn t helped by every corridor on every floor being decorated identically like being trapped in a maze,0
 Everything about the stay was perfect We had a great time here,0
 Due to ongoing improvements to hotel the breakfast dining room was moved to a smaller room on our second day and the breakfast was cold ,0
 Renovations going on so could be a little noisy at times ,0
 Hotel under renovation Noisy building works reception area drab and unwelcoming ,0
 The hotel was lovely the weather however was not,0
 Restaurant food terrible hotel undergoing renovations The lifts were rubbish we waited for 11 lifts going up and down and ended up using the goods lift to get down,0
 The location did not feel safe I walked alone to Kings Cross Station during the afternoon and was hassled twice by 2 different men The renovations do not compensate for the poor location ,0
 there was no fan in the bathroom ,0
 Not very convenient for either King s Cross or Russel Square underground stations ,0
 Had evening meal a couple of times in the hotel and although the food was good it took ages to arrive 45 minutes and I was simply told The kitchen is too busy with room service Need chairs to sit at the desk in the room to be more business friendly The concierge needs to smile more ,0
 Very small rooms we had a superior room so I cannot imagine how small are the normal rooms Also we found it very expensive for location quality of the rooms Not so close from Kings Cross about 20 min walk TV not working Staff did not repair it over 2 days but they offered us a discount on the room Fair enough ,0
 Room was really hot Air con does not cool just recirc air and window cannot be opened Complained and where moved New room was exact same ,0
 the room was cold but the staff provided a heater so okay would have liked a bathtub but the wet room was an excellent standard with a superb shower The food was a good standard though not exciting ,0
 Room had 2 double beds and a nice working desk but made for cramped space Wifi wasn t great in my room ,0
 Our initial allocation of a room on the 2nd floor this floor has yet to be renovated and was a smoking floor We complained and were immediately relocated to Level 5 which was terrific ,0
 The toilet malfunctioned on the last day Reported to reception and they promised to sort it out It was not anyone s making but it was frustrating a bit ,0
 Restauant menu was a bit boring The construction work on the hotel refurbishment was inconvenient ,0
 Well obviously the renovations in the restaurant were a problem no real air conditioning on the hottest day of the year but efficient room service,0
 No hot water in morning Soundproofing between us and next room was a locked partition door we could hear their conversations and other noises ,0
 The lifts in the building were very inefficient due to renovations taking place Some time had to use the emergency stair well to get to the ground floor ,0
 The construction noise from the hotel remodelling ,0
 It was a busy and crowded Bank Holiday weekend and there were real issues with only one lift seemingly in operation and an 8 floor building ,0
 There could have been a better choice of pastries for breakfast The cheese and ham were poor quality and unapoealing and cold croissants are awful More lifts needed and pool dominated by children till after 7 30 ,0
 Breakfast terrible for the price no choice more of a canteen look to it Room in need off refurbishment Hotel in need off refurbishment tiles falling Lifts not working Use stair most times My Bathroom smelled strongly of urine ,0
 Location too far from bus routes shopping and theatres I e not handy,0
 Having read the advertisement for the hotel and drawn by the presence of a pool and a gym I thought the hotel very good value for money However I was disappointed that those facilities required separate payment and so have revised my opinion somewhat ,0
 Location was a bit far from Underground station and the construction was noisy in the day ,0
 During our 3 night stay the fire alarm went off 3 times in the middle of the night once in our first night and twice in the last The noise was deafening and sleepy people in night clothes came out to the corridor to see if there is a fire Nobody even apologized for false alarms and poor sleep quality when we checked out Although nearly each suitcase comes with a producer s warning that it should not be lifted by using the pull handle the luggage storage guy lifted the suitcases only that way and was really arrogant when I asked him not to Two functioning elevators were far too few for a hotel of that size Staying on the 5th floor we experienced it every morning that the elevator that was heading down to the ground floor was already too full when it reached our floor having started from the 7th By the 4th floor at the latest it was impossible to enter the elevator So make sure to ask for a room on the highest floor We could not find the stairs to use them instead no idea how we would have found our way out if there indeed would have been a fire ,0
 No dislikes Was allocated one of the refurbished rooms and it was lovely breakfast also very good with a variety of fresh food to suit every taste ,0
 Having major improvements but for 277 for 2 nights I didn t expect to be woken at 7 45am to the sound of drilling under our window Noise was terrible Went to spa at 7pm the pool was full of kids so couldn t use it and a man was sat on side of hot tub in wet boxers exposing himself Final night decided to eat in restaurant asked for steak medium rare which came back twice medium to well done For 20 you expect what you paid for so we went to pub across the road which was excellent We were given a discount of 20 per night At such high prices I will not be staying there again ,0
 The dining room was really small and very littleroom to move felt like every inch of space was a table so couldn t walk around easily The first day we ended up in a small alternative room The toast was cooked and brought down so was cold ,0
 Drilling 2 4 mornings before 10am One other day woke up by workmen WiFi was unusable from the room Was told I needed to walk 15 minutes to get something to eat when we got back from a night out No night porter or food services at all Pool gym only available to residents at 3 50 per person per visit ,0
 The construction works woke me up at 8am I phoned to reception several times and the problem was not resolved This was stressful and not what I had hoped for ,0
 The bedrooms were really tight to fit into The breakie was good food but quite chaotic and too busy to relax The two lifts were also soooo slow In one of our rooms the air con broke so we had to move rooms also the other room the bathtub blocked ,0
 Staff arguing with each other in restaurant Building work Shower floods bathroom Location to tube station and anything else Cost per night considering above ,0
 System was down both in the evening and morning no real apology and even the chains Twitter account fobbed us off Think I ll be heading back to my usual hotel in London ,0
 wifi didn t work well the pay tv didn t work and I could not receive a bill at the end of my stay ,0
 Strange 5 steps down to elevators was a mild drag for hauling luggage This was the absolutely worst thing ,0
 took 5 requests to get the sofa bed made into a sofa even having booked it however the receptionist was very good ,0
 Only a service lift for people with limited mobility which was not working on the day we left There was a pool available but you had to pay extra to use it which was not made clear on the website ,0
 What I didn t grasp when booking was that when they said refurbishments were going on that meant a jack hammer on the floor beneath us at 8am The restaurant had gigantic AC units in the dining room I m sure it will be beautiful in due time And we got a good price due to the construction I suppose But it was not entirely done and the poor staff seemed harried ,0
 Some areas were under renovation around us noise was not an issue however having to reroute patrons to an entrance to the elevator requiring the use of steps with luggage was a real pain Close to bus line but about 15 min or more to closest tube WiFI did not work very well from our room ,0
 Staff were very cold and too formal just prepared to do the bare minimum I was surprised by the cold attitude The manager in charge has to be sent for hospitality training so that he can in turn teach and hire people who are hospitable and suited for the industry This was very different from all the previous holiday inn hotels i have stayed before What a waste great resources put to waste by unhospitable attitude of employees retraining on customer service and PR is an absolute necessity ,0
 Hotel is under construction and disturbing noises start in the early morning Free wifi but it disconnects every 5 minutes Location is not the best place to stay Poor breakfast Far too expensive for what you get ,0
 Wifi was really bad in the room and the whole place was being renovated So there was really loud noise all day This renovation was not mentioned while booking and the price was still very high despite this renovation I felt completely cheated ,0
 The nearest tube station Kings Cross is at least 15 min walk away The smoke alarm rang shrilly without any reason thrice on our first of three nights effectively spoiling the night s sleep ,0
 It was quite difficult to hail a taxi in the morning ,0
 Noisy hotel under reconstruction Relatively far from King s cross station Mold in the bathroom We were awakened by the sound of the drill around 8 a m I would definetely not recommend this hotel ,0
 View from room Building works This was probably why the cost was so reasonable,0
 Housekeepers too keen and should check reception for who has checked out Knocked and walked straight in twice when I was in bed ,0
 Location was a 15min walk from nearest tube and walking back in the evening through fairly quiet streets was a little intimidating,0
 When we booked we specifically requested on site parking was told 20 for overnight stay when we arrived car park was posed and had been since January so we had to wks to another car park and paid 9 more poor service from booking com We had to report that bedtime had long black hairs on it tea cups and saucers were filthy Whole stay felt like we had been cheated out of our money wouldn t stay again,0
 The hotel was undergoing refurbishment works so was noisy in working hours but acknowledge this is unavoidable ,0
 Breakfast a little disappointing hot food was lovely but very limited fresh fruit no berries Pastries very dry and again very poor selection Was not offered toast unable to toast bread ourselves,0
 There was lot of construction noise as renovation on few floors were going on The rate is too high compared to what they offer Not worth the price we paid ,0
 Staff were not very pleasant They seemed to do there job with efficiency but with little customer service motivation A friendly smile along with a genuineness wouldn t go a miss ,0
 No parking due to refurb Outside of the building would benefit a clean in upper regions to reflect the clean inside but i expect this is in the pipeline after work is completed ,0
 Thick yoghurt please ,0
 Refurbishment in progress so only 2 lifts working for the whole hotel and NO FOOD available after 11pm not even bar snacks ,0
 Refurbishment in progress Only one of the two elevators would stop at our floor Going upstairs downstairs was a nightmare Room was quite small ,0
 The guy in the restaurant area wasn t very attentive I had to track him down to get a refill of water ,0
 They did not solve my WiFi issues but instead ran me in circles with various excuses that were inconsistent Some would say it s out of service other would say there are dark spots in hotel one tried to help for 30 second and gave up They seemed understaffed and willing to give random answers without trying to help I was there for business and won t return Also Non dairy breakfast options were inadequate ,0
 Stop the bloody constant alarm going off and oh my god let the potential customers know that there is construction happening at the hotel Cant believe all the above compared to the expensive price at the same time Diagraceful WIFI as my 2G network would be far better than their silly snail like WIFI Disgraceful for them to also charge to use the swimming pool 3 10 rating ,0
 The fire alarm went off at 2 am then noisy renovation going on in the morning but we weren t there to sleep ,0
 Very disappointed to find no tea and coffee facilities in the room Plus there were builders drilling in the room next door on a Sunday morning which caused disturbance to our sleep ,0
 Wasn t happy with the Internet wifi signal very frustratingly kept disconnectin and the tv was difficult to use regarding your films opinion tried to press menu just didn t bother in the end however it s not like I d not stay again I did think was a very nice helpful staff,0
 The place is under construction so was woken in the morning and couldn t sleep in the day There should have been a discount ,0
 Wifi is poor And you get kick out all the time So you have to put in the id and password again which is not friendly Wifi is probabely the top on the necessity list Having to keeping in the id and password is really pain ,0
 The extremely slow wifi and the 2 device only limitation There should be a shower door as well to keep water from splashing to the toilet ,0
 Noisy neighbours at a ridiculous hour but was very well handled by staff Thin walls ,0
 Only issue was the noise was horrendous A lot worse than expected and very early in the morning all weekend ,0
 We know the hotel was being refurbished and from the comments on Booking com and so we were expecting to stay in a refurbished room Besides this we asked on the reservation for a room in the upper floors They gave us room 201 an old room where you can see dust everywhere and lots of faulty things You can also hear EVERYTHING in the corridors and rooms nearby from people walking talking and having a shower It s definitely far from being a 4 hotel When I complained about not having a refurbished room at the checkout the only thing I was told was you should have asked ,0
 The construction was unpleasant and the un upgraded portions were lacking Staff not particularly empathetic to the effect of the construction on their guests It s not as close to Kings Cross station as I thought the name is a bit deceiving ,0
 Noise from outside and inside Acoustic is not so good Gym to be paid extra ,0
 We were unaware there was an extra charge for the pool as we were looking forward to a swim after a day of sight seeing ,0
 We were placed in a smoking room on arrival despite our booking specifically stating that we had booked a non smoking room This room was disgusting dingy and it reeked of stale smoke Staff told us the hotel was fully booked and so we were unable to be moved that night We were also woken up by drilling at 8am ,0
 We would have liked some information for tourists with a list of top rated restaurants in the area local travel services how to get to the main London attractions and local knowledge No services such as preloaded travel cards and a map of the area were offered Luckily we had our smartphones with us otherwise it would have been difficult to navigate where we wanted to go ,0
 Don t stay if looking for space,0
 Didn t consider it value for money 200 pp didn t even include breakfast Had to pay extra for a swim which I wasn t Aware of until I arrived Unfortunately on arrival Internet didn t work and neither did TV ,0
 The staff were not good with English very surprising given we were in the uk The breakfast was poor The lifts inadequate for the size of the hotel ,0
 Horrendous noise from building works Aware that improvements were being made to some bedrooms but not informed of the sheer scale of noise coming from the extensive refurbishment of the reception area We couldn t get away from the noise both in our room and in the spa Disappointed a charge now applies for the leisure facilities Staff unable to help at times had to ask 3 members of staff the same question and none of them understood English ,0
 they claimed on there website that this was a 5 10 min walk this is completely incorrect we walked for approxamitly 20 mins from kings cross,0
 Breakfest room is hot and old style Breakfest menu is simple Elevators are slow and not sufficiant for such a big hotel Maybe because of ongoing reconstruction ,0
 Building work meant that the common areas of hotel are limited and cramped Breakfast was not great Dining room lacks comfort or style Although newly refurbished room felt too small ,0
 The hotel is a bit hard to reach It s 15 minutes walking to St Pancras Kings Cross It s not a super pleasant walk I must say ,0
 The spa jacuzzi too powerful and steam room burning hot Lounge area was poor,0
 Very poor overall for money spent Drilling started first thing in the morning Room very expensive and dumped into non refurbished area Lifts complete nightmare Spent 35 MINUTES trying to get lift to ground floor Not impressed at all Barely adequate room at ridiculously expensive price The bedrooms that have not been refurbished yet shouldn t be used as not up to standard Or offer them at lower price Very disappointed ,0
 Not the cleanest of hotels and lots of building works going on making it very noisy in the day The spa facility s charge also ,0
 Air conditioning was adequate but would have liked if the window opened for some fresh air Lock on bathroom was faulty but should be easily fixed by the maintenance dept ,0
 Wifi didnt work very well but other than that no complaints ,0
 We stayed in room 407 WIfI wasn t good at all it never worked The design of the bath made it difficult to get in and out plus the water never went that warm The tv had a very limited amount of channels compared to other hotels we have stayed ,0
 There was construction work outside but no problems couldn t hear anything in the mornings ,0
 for a large luxury hotel very tight with their complimentary items Had a double room with 1 bottle of still and 1 bottle of sparkling water 1 kitkat and 1 packet of biscuits containing 2 biscuits with the coffee tea ,0
 The car park was advertised as open it was closed They did not advertise that you had to pay for the gym I have never heard of that before in a hotel The lifts did not work and they did not put up a sign saying so we were put on the smoking floor they serve terrible wine at the bar The place is under refurbishment and needs it the whole place needs it ,0
 Building operations and lack of signage outside the hotel indicating the entrance made access a guess ,0
 It is implied that the gym is included in the price It isn t and you have to pay 3 50 The gym equipment is dated and doesn t justify this extra expense There is also work going on at the hotel at the moment ,0
 Although there is air conditioning in the room the windows are screwed shut so you can t get any fresh air in the room A definite negative point for me ,0
 booked the hotel solely on the strength that there was parking and a punch bag in the gym arrived at the hotel to find there was neither parking was unavailable due to refurbishment forcing us to use a NCP car park down the road for 28 per night punch bag had been taken down ages ago according to member of staff on the gym desk although still showed it being up in the hotel pics,0
 This is my threatment upon attemting to checking in Unfortunatley you booked through booking com Unfortunatley you havent paid yet Unfortunatley your room is not ready yet 12 15 and i had advised at booking stage Unfortunatley your card is not authorized On checking in something went wronh with my card I asked were was the nearest atm and i withdrew the ammount from the same card and the same card worked fine everywhere else No attempt from the lady to try it out again At this point i was already feeling pretty unfortunate Wifi was barley at my room 414 1 signal bar There are refurbishing underway and i would have loved to know if i was aware at booking stage The concierge on the otherhand were sublime in fact thats the only reason i scored better the service welldone to the concierge,0
 the hotel is under going renovations you can hear the drilling the location is not ideal nearest tube station is 12 min walk the staff and the concierge were not not helping at all not we had to handle our bags out and in a stared entrance and when complained about the drilling the simply asked us to leave instead of offering some kind of compensation,0
 Wifi should be complimentary ,0
 The size of the room was disappointing especially as ours was a supposedly superior room Once the travel cot had been installed we could hardly move Also storage was an issue Both these issues made having the buggy in the room very difficult ,0
 The female Reception staff English speaking levels weren t great had to get them to repeat questions on a few occasions Walls were obviously very thin because we had the room next door complain that we were laughing to loudly at 11pm however come 8am the next morning their baby woke us up with its crying double edged sword really Hotel isnt a close walk to a Tube station nor is it located with any real tourist points of interest I personally dont care about that as im a Londoner but i do feel its location is abit of a pain because you have to get a Bus to the nearest tube if your not a fan of rain or walking ,0
 Bar area needs an upgrade ,0
 We didn t know the hotel was undergoing renovations and when mentioned this to the concierge all he could say was that everyone was complaining about it and that it was on their website Which we hadn t used to book They also said work was happening 9 5 but on the second day we were woken before 8 30am with banging and drilling which was so loud the bed shook On the first day we ordered breakfast they sent the wrong one and by the time we got the correct one it was cold and rubbery It was a pretty stressful and unpleasant experience all round ,0
 Bed was very soft my personal preference is very hard Broken window latch so room got cold overnight Faulty power outlet and wifi had a weak signal it only worked when I stood by the door ,0
 Work been carried out at hotel which I was aware but not the fact car park will be closed also Should have been clearer prior to booking Closest car park 5 mins walk not great about 4am in the morning with rain Hotel car park is very small not many parking spaces ,0
 The hotel is about a mile from the nearest tube at Kings Cross Station which is not made clear on the website Walking in the evening from the tube station along Kings Cross road was not very pleasant ,0
 building work going on to refurbish the hotel but stops around 5 o clock,0
 TV broke minor disruption caused by ongoing refurbishment no complimentary tea coffee water provided ,0
 The car park was closed no information given at time of booking Rude ignorant unhelpful staff told me to go to another hotel that was their only offer of help I will never use this chain of hotels again ,0
 Dissapointed we weren t told about renovations in progress and the car park being closed during the renovations ,0
 Hotel parking is closed due to refurbishment so had to park in the NCP which was expensive Also a shame there isn t a tube station closer by but that s hardly something te hotel can control ,0
 Reception bar and restaurant area are all being refurbished later this year which will bring them up to the standard of the rest of the refurbed rooms ,0
 Difficult to get a cab despite only a short walk to the stations it was raining clearly not the hotels fault though ,0
 The 8th floor has a constant hum it would be useful if reception staff informed guests of that when they arrive I had to be moved at 3am as I struggled to sleep ,0
 The first room was not what had been booked It was also on a smoking corridor Although the room was non smoking opening the door on to the corridor was horrid the smell of smoke was pervasive I also thought the bathroom was tired grouting stained and unpleasant ,0
 Not in the best location due to distances to tubes or kings cross but only a short walk or quick taxi ride 5 ,0
 N A,0
 The hotel bar staf were not very friendly the larger was flat and not cold and when we complained we were not understood and were given the same flat drink The pool was smaller than we thought and busy ,0
 We couldn t use the pool on both mornings because it was full Apparently they only allow max of 12 ppl and they charge you to use the facilities even as a hotel guest When we checked in they assigned us the old room which was outdated and the bed was worn down I literally felt veryigo just lying on the bed Worst of all they gave us a room right below the renovation work so there were loud bangings drilling and sanding in the morning My 7month old woke up in a startle from the banging and sicked My husband was fuming because the staff at reception wasnt very helpful until he demanded to speak to the manager who moved us to a higher floor to the newly renovated room ,0
 on arrival I was given a room card three times I had to return to reception as the cards would not open the door on the occasion prior to my third visit to reception I had telephoned from the corridor telephone and was informed a concierge would meet me at my room with a new card to open my room door I waited almost 15 minutes for this to happen and then decided to return to reception where my room card was again exchanged and I was escorted to my room to ensure the card worked which it did at no point through this 30 minute experience was an apology given for the frustration The hotel Bar also looked tired and the bar tender obviously wasn t aware he could keep the surface free from spilt drinks or polish the wood to reduce its stickyness my colleague that booked the day prior also gained a better rate for his room by 12 I use Holiday as often as possible and usually have a very easy care free stay this occasion could have been better,0
 The staff have no customer service skills was put in a smoking room when asked to be placed in a non smoking We asked to be moved and was sent to the second floor where someone was bringing up the keys waited for 15 mins in gowns outside the room The resraunt was closed and was unable to eat i strongly urge you not to go to this establishment and I won t be using the company again,0
 Wasn t as close to kings cross as you think 10 15 min walk depending how fast you walk ,0
 Very rude member of staff at breakfast Firstly it was noticeable that those who had breakfast included in their stay were shunted off to a side room which was far dingier than the dining room used for those who were paying extra for breakfast On asking a member of staff for some butter having been unable to find some on the buffet she rudely grunted that it is on the buffet and walked away The sauna facility in the spa was in poor repair especially considering the additional fee for use Despite these minor grumbles the hotel offered great value for money and I would stay again ,0
 Refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance There was renovation on some floors but overall no impact for me to the stay during this visit as a new room was allocated from onset ,0
 Refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance substantial renovation on floors and lobby meant that as a business traveler it was not a hassle free stay Hotel management changed me to a new room 1 day after arrival which was great but booking com should have notified of this situation upon booking this hotel ,0
 I didn t find the staff helpful at all I hadn t been in that area before and asked a few staff for advice on where to go for eating and shopping There response was short and not very pleasant Breakfast was included in our stay but was cold and not tasty at all,0
 Hotel staffs were not trained at all The receptionists were rude and did not have any qualities match to the hotel brand name Holiday Inn I called the reception because our heating was not working but she hang up before I finished talking I Just could not believe it Also the insite parking was closed due to the refurblishment but there was no information about it when I booked with booking com so we had to park our brand new car in the street around I made a complain when I checked in but the receptionist accused me I was wrong that I did not check Holiday inn website That was very very rude of her saying and I was pretty upset If people book through booking com or Expedia or other websites she should know not all people check their official site to get information in advance I was treated with almost all the people working there with no respect If you know what good service is because you travel around all over the world this hotel is not for you They are in London but they DO NOT have mentality as British I RECOMMEND NOT TO CHOSE THIS HOTEL IF YOU EXPECT EXCELLENT SERVICE FROM FAMOUS BRAND NAME ,0
 The car park was closed as refurbishment going on this wasn t advertised at time of booking and car parking at an extra charge was a main reason for choosing this hotel We were disappointed on arrival to find no parking available Had to park a 10 minute walk away ,0
 The beds sounds like you are sleeping in a carrier bag Due to this one thing I slept only 1 hour the whole night The shower also naturally floods the bathroom making it unpleasant for the next person to take a shower when you share Only one bathrobe for 2 people only 1 floor towel for 2 people plus floor towel useless due to extreme flooding in the bathroom ,0
 I walked to to hotel and although it s about 15 mins walk from Kings Cross station but I didn t realise its on a bus route with frequent buses to Kings Cross Although hotel isn t near any tube stations its easy to get to Kings Cross for tube etc ,0
 Second hotel we ve stayed in and we have stayed in quite a few that doesn t have a wee biscuit with the tea coffee tray ,0
 The breakfast was very good but it was expensive ,0
 Tv was annoying Water made skin burn Indian restaurant not great but few options nearby when raining Alarm went off multiple times during the night without any announcement Thin walls Changes in nightly rates were extreme as was cost of breakfast ,0
 The bath was too small,0
 Asked for a quite room but was woken during the night by a noisy child next door or above me a few times Corridor fire doors need improving to close quietly after noisy late guests fling them open ,0
 Room service food wasn t as expected and varied disappointingly from menu ie chicken and bacon burger had no bacon Mozzarella and pesto panini had no pesto Might sound like I m being fussy but if you re dropping 10 15 on a sandwich you least expect it to be right Also the hotel was cheaper 100 a night due to refurbishments but this meant being woken at 9am on a Sunday by loud banging and drilling that felt like it was next to our head We rang reception and they did stem the loud noises for an hour but was still a bit rubbish for a Sunday morning even with the discount ,0
 No coat hooks in bedroom Breakfast food was passable have recently had better breakfast buffet at another hotel My partner thought the hash browns were too greasy ,0
 They have some parking but they reserve it for thier managers Not what they told me after I drove for two hours becuase they said it would be ok to get parked The recommended the ncp down the road in Farringdon do not use it it is like a scene from a horror film and I doubt your car would be there in the morning ,0
 No halal in breakfast ,0
 A good 15 minute walk from train tube station expensive for what s on offer better quality hotels in London for similar cost,0
 A mix up on my booking made me quite annoyed when I checked in One receptionist couldn t do much to assist but another redeemed the situation and allocated me the room i had booked ,0
 The bed was uncomfortable mattress far too hard Shocked at having to pay 3 50 each to use gym and pool never had to do this at any other Hotel I hav stayed at as always been free for guests really disappointing,0
 WiFi did not work Rooms never ever had 30 square metres as advertised they had a maximum of 20 Matresses were worn out ,0
 The Bar staff were not very friendly The toilets for the foyer bar area and restaurant are in the basement which is too far away Cost of wifi is ridiculous In this day and age wifi is generaly free everywhere I was thoroughly disappointed to see this hotel charged for such a basic service This would definitely make me think twice about staying there again ,0
 They put us in a diabled room for some reason the walls were so thin you heard everything soup dispenser empty hair dryer not working ,0
 staff rude and impolite,0
 Limited parking spaces and expensive bedroom for what you get Also food menu for room service limited to what u can order ,0
 The name is quite misleading as it s a good 10 minute walk from KX more if you ve heavy luggage and it s not really in Bloomsbury Smokers and cigarette butts outside the main door ,0
 Unable to connect to WiFi in room empty mini bar no complimentary drinking water far from underground stations Charge for health club,0
 Twice asked for a champagne bucket and ice to be delivered to the room once upon checking in and by calling reception from the room some 20 mins later it never arrived ,0
 Hotel was expensive probably due to high demand Rugby World Cup Disappointed at having to pay extra for wifi and indoor pool Also major refurbishment is taking place on 5th floor so there was noise of drilling even on weekend This was not mentioned at time of booking ,0
 It is a good walk from Kings Cross Not a bad location for what it is but I would suggest it is a 10 15 minute walk ,0
 Shame breakfast wasn t included It is way over the top expensive It s a little bit out of the way of tube stations etc ,0
 The wifi connection is completely useless no matter how many times I tried and with 3 different login account I still can t login Had to consume my roaming data ,0
 Fire alarm seems to go off frequently causing lifts to stop working Objected to paid wi fi,0
 We arrived to be greeted by a very grumpy receptionist who despite me assuring her I had followed all the procedures and requested a newly refurbished room as part of my booking kept barking at me that you had to pay more our friends who were also staying at the hotel followed exactly the same process paid exactly the same and got a new room We were not asked for a swipe of any card etc so then struggled to get anything in addition to the room room service was a joke We were woken at 5am by the smoke alarm and when we asked at breakfast how this had happened we got waved away by the staff as if they were trying to keep it a big secret the icing on the cake was the 3 99 my husband paid for a bottle of sparkling water from the hotel shop yes 3 99 Our room didn t have any hot drink making facilities or water in the room so we needed something an absolute rip off and a horrible hotel with a dreadful approach to customer service do not waste your money I have stayed in many many hotels in london which have in some cases been cheaper but in all cases had a much better experience absolutely will not be staying there again neither will our friends,0
 We booked a smoking room as both myself and my husband smoke but were surprised that the windows didn t open at all Although the air conditioning was enough to keep the room cool and air circulating it would have been nice to let some fresh air in even if it was from just a crack ,0
 The wifi wasn t free lame ,0
 no food even a sandwich after 1030 I was travelling from Europe arriving at 12am and I was offered a takeaway which would take 1hr to arrive,0
 Wifi a ridiculous price Air conditioning in room not working properly To be fair though we didn t report it so can t really complain ,0
 We can t get any alcohol after 10 30pm That was quite inconvenient ,0
 Bit further away from Kings cross than I was expecting,0
 That I only stayed one night ,0
 Everything,0
 Staff very unhelpful and not professional,0
 Lack of toiletries only had a soap and a conditioner bottle no showergel or shampoo ,0
 Location restaurant needs more selection,0
 I was satisfied with all amenities and services,0
 Room temperature air con did not work or was not effective or efficient,0
 The experience and rudeness of staff and lack of information,0
 The Belgian beer bar closed at 11pm,0
 The breakfast was not that interesting and part of it cold ,0
 No enough staff on reception,0
 I parked in the carpark for 40 mins in the morning with permission and got a parking ticket That s the thanks I got,0
 Room was not as nice as first visit smaller and smelly ,0

 Slow service in restaurant,0
 Pillows were too thick Bit stingy on the sugars and milks ,0
 Hotel felt a little tired but then they are currently refurbishing it ,0
 It was an extremely dated hotel Needs a serious revamp ,0
 Needed a little more space for 2 suitcases ,0
 Didn t provide flannels small towels,0
 Very crowded at breakfast,0
 Room decor was a bit jaded and outdated but still clean ,0
 Little bit far from tube station But perfect for our visit to friends,0
 Internet didn t work in the room,0
 The room we were upgraded to featured a double bed made of two singles which kept moving apart ,0
 Breakfast was low quality although many choices There are great restaurants next door howecer and stores nearby Space in the mini bar and coffee maker in room was a bonus ,0
 The corridors could have been a little wider for luggage A better iron and ironing board wouldn t go a miss and The tap in the bathroom was hard to turn on too However apart from that everything was perfect ,0
 Fairly tight room for three people sharing,0
 The room is quite small but not out of the norm for Europe There is very little room to have suitcases open ,0
 There s no where to hang up towels after a shower and the room was very compact ,0
 The metro was like 10min by walk and if you are planning to shop and use the metro it tAkes like 30 to champ elysees or Madeleine or etc and when u walk back to hotel from the train station is all up the street so makes u more tired after a long day ,0
 Instead of a door knob there was an opening in the bathroom door,0
 Some staff were not very friendly Took a while to warm up to you There was some miss communication with the airier pick up I gave them all the flight info but because they could identify the airline code they didn t send a pick up They could have easily called the airport or type in the airline code I provided But little apology was given they seemed more intent on blaming me for not receiving their email Anyway public transport worked out to be much cheaper and easy thank you Paris metro ,0
 It was noisy I was in a room in the ground floor which was noisy and not very illuminated ,0
 While we were lucky to be given an upgrade the room was smallish but this is common place in Paris ,0
 Forget to ask about the airport shuttle ,0
 1 Wish they their room service was actually 24 hours as mentioned Unfortunately when we ordered meals by 11 00pm the staff had already left The staff apparently was from the cafe restaurant next door ,0
 A couple of times when they were cleaning the rooms the staff appeared a little disorganized vacuum cleaners left in the middle of the halls Rooms are a little small but well furnished ,0
 TV had only French channels No BBC CNN EuroNews English I find it unusual not having any newchannel in English where most customers were not French Please control your payment one day before check out time I checked my bill one before my checkout day In my case there was a discrepancy between their room rate and booking com rate It was later corrected I had the print out booking com t helped me If it were on the day I check out there would be problem Advise for booking com customers ,0
 At night you have to ring the bell to go inside the hotel and usually that takes time so be prepared to wait on the door from 5 to 10 min,0
 Each night there were loud drunk people out on the square in front of the hotel It was not possible to sleep with windows open The Sunday night concierge gave us wrong directions pointing us in the wrong direction to rue St Jaque He was also unable to locate the first aid kit that the weekday staff had provided for us after getting a small cut On our last day the cleaning crew only gave us one bath towel Lots of little mistakes that added up to a mediocre review The room was very small We had to dance around each other if we were both standing at the same time We preferred staying in the 6th as it was quieter and had more upscale restaurants and stores This was just our preference though ,0
 a weak stream of water like all europe we got used to it we herd the noise street but we were so tierd so we slept good centeral aircodition work on heat in april so its a problem if its hot days we had 18 20 zelius degree so it was ok for us,0
 The rooms are tiny and if you have suitcases don t get the standard room It s as big as my walk in closet Also the view from the back rooms is of other guests windows I don t suggest Get a front facing room ,0
 Booked small double we expected a small room not child size double bed I am 5 8 and with my head on the pilow my feet were out of bed resulting in a poor night s sleep Helpful receptionist explained the hotel was full but nevertheless moved us to a twin room for the second night sleeping in separate beds meant we had some room to move but again the beds were very narrow We would have liked a hotel bar area by lift looked like may have been intended as a bar but was not staffed ,0
 Would be nice to have also some vegetables for breakfast ,0
 No complaints but do not go to Boullion Chartier restaurant if recommended It is cheap but not good Food very basic long queues by locals as cheap Ran out of food options early in the evening ,0
 Wifi signal this is a permanent weakness in the Hotel And it seems to me that room 27 was not the only which had connection problems as there were always guests in the reception sitting in the sofas taking advantage of the good wifi there was THERE Apart from this issue I strongly recommend Select Hotel for those who do not mind to have a wifi operational signal successfully active only in the hotel reception But I do repeat this is the only dislike I can tell from Select Hotel and I shall be there again when i get back to Paris ,0
 The tiny lift and very narrow staircase to the room and the limited space in the room I stayed in could be a problem if you have luggage ,0
 Coffee machine at breakfast could be improved ,0
 There was no soap in the bathroom The night manager tried to find some for us in the hotel but didn t find any The safe was very small could not fit a laptop Breakfast was so so ,0
 The Room is a bit small for guests coming for long trips with a bigger suitcase,0
 The continental breakfast wasn t worth it worth going out or the hotel,0
 The bed was a bit hard for us but that s simply a matter of preference ,0
 I forgot a jacket on my room so I would have liked if they would have contacted me to let me know I had left it so I could make arrangements to collect it before I left Paris to South Africa ,0
 Everything was perfect Merci tous I didn t have breakfast in hotel because we were walking all around Paris all day with friends but other customers said it was excellent ,0
 all of the staff were very helpful and friendly except of one staff that he never satisfied our requests and inquiries he was not friendly and with short temper the breakfast is good and clean but does not have much variety there is no business center but they offer a tablet at the reception for customers when needed You have to walk 12 or 15 min to get to the nearest subway station ,0
 Could have been a bit warmer in the bedroom but that is more our fault for not asking the staff to increase the room temperature I am sure if we had asked it would have been done This is being nit picky though ,0
 The breakfast starts at 7 while I had to leave at 6 15 I am not sure whether the labor laws in France allow it to start the breakfast at 6 but it would be nice ,0
 No restaurant and bar was closed at 9 I had no wifi in my room I complained 3 times to one member of staff and twice to another it never got resolved so I had to sit in the reception to use my tablet were they watched me do this,0
 Rooms are on the small side although that s normal for Paris Location is a little more south than most tourist sites but transit is available ,0
 Shower tiles joins had some mold that were almost completely cleaned after I mentioned it to the reception ,0
 all went well with me ,0
 Wi Fi is an issue Select must solve at all I personally talked to them in a very positive attitude But it is undoubtful That I shall continue to choose Select Hotel as my staying in Paris ,0
 Bedroom small for an executive double Little drawer or luggage space ,0
 Hotel seems over designed Design features sometimes seems more pretty than practical Open bathroom design is trendy now and there s a shower curtain that provided some privacy but there s no bathroom door Toilet is separate but there s no sink so you have to walk around to the other side of the room to wash your hands And there s no bin in the toilet,0
 Elevator finds it hard to cope in busy periods e g morning checkout time ,0
 Breakfast was just ok could have included eggs but that s very minor,0
 Minor things the lift was a bit small there were no English language channels available and sometimes they were a bit slow replenishing hot foods at breakfast ,0
 The breakfast is the weakest link They have an outstanding breakfast at Hotel Des Gobelins If they could have something similar I would never stay at a different hotel in my future stays in Paris ,0
 The room was a little small and the breakfast area too hot at times,0
 The TV didn t work although we did not call for help The light switches were hard to figure out I wasn t able to turn on the reading lights on the bed without turning on the rest of the room lights Not a big deal for a one night stay ,0
 The breakfast was a bit limited and the staff for this service were very slow Most of the people were complaining about it,0
 Elevator was a bit small but in a building this beautiful and old in such a lovely location that can quickly be forgiven,0
 The breakfast selection wasn t great and they ran out of a lot of things ,0
 We were up on the 4th floor and could not cool our room down since the air conditioning was set centrally Very warm Another disappointment were the directions from CDG airport that were given from the Select website Instead of the recommended bus we would take the train Much quicker and easier with no transfers Other than those two things we absolutely loved our stay and will be back ,0
 The cleaning staff was inconsistent and did not provide us with sufficient toiletries i e toilet paper soap so we would have to go down to the front desk to request them which was a bit of a hassle ,0
 rooms on the small side but man its Paris and this is a lovely hotel to stay in and area to visit ,0
 hard to fault ,0
 No parking ,0
 Bedroom a little small but more than adequate Toaster slow ,0
 Neither the phone or tv worked but it didn t t matter that much we notified staff as we were leaving ,0
 Room and bathroom were tiny could barely towel myself in the bathroom without hitting my elbows Had to sit sideways on the toilet due to highly inadequate leg room ,0
 I didn t like the fact the toilet had no sink so you couldn t immediately wash your hands Also the bathroom had no door and was right opposite our bed If one was showering and the other sleeping and the bathroom lights straight in his face and the noise of the shower I know there are better rooms we stayed in better and will make a point to ask for one next time ,0
 Breakfast could have been better ,0
 I was given two single beds instead of the double that I booked this was not changed for the first two nights of my 3 night stay the cleaner used a very powerful and to me at least unpleasant room spray despite requests not to breakfast was poor ,0
 No thing actually ,0
 Was twin single beds pushed together instead of double ,0
 Some people will find the rooms too small for their taste We did not mind and were happy to compromise on space for the beautiful decor Breakfast is just ok so book without and eat at nearby cafes ,0
 Proper double bed rather than 2 singles put together ,0
 The maid service is iffy We stayed for 6 days and only had our room cleaned for 3 of those days although we left early in the morning and didn t return till mid afternoon The biggest problem is the design of the rooms especially the bathrooms It s as if the designer thought how can I make this bathroom as difficult as possible to use The sink takes up half the room leaving no room for storing toiletries but it s so badly designed that the water only trickles out because otherwise the sink would overflow The taps are round and smooth so you can t turn them off with wet hands which is kind of the point of using them You have to walk under the shower to set the temperature so you freeze or boil while doing so The rooms even for Paris are extremely small so you end up with bruises from constantly tripping over furniture Too bad because it s a wonderful location and the front desk staff are great ,0
 All was great with the hotel Only thing was the fee to get a taxi back to the airport was 20 euros more going back because the hotel was booking it for us Very very odd ,0
 Rooms are a bit dated iron was old and leaked dirt on to clothes They could have cleared tables of used plates so we didn t have to,0
 Room was really quite small limited with 2 bags as was the bed though you couldn t have got a bigger bed in there I know they are in the process of renovating some floors and maybe could add better lighting to the hallways leading up to room and bigger numbers on doors ,0
 Wifi access was non existent in my room near the lobby and at breakfast,0
 I had searched for a three person room and was disappointed with the size of the room and that there were not three equal beds The third bed looked more like a sofa bed Other than that it was fine Location is good cleanliness could be improved we found a big lump of hair in the room All in all I didn t find that the hotel met my expectations ,0
 Pricing is very high particularly for early Spring ,0
 Breakfast was somewhat limited ,0
 bathroom tap designs were absurd trouble to operate with wet hands or know which was cold hot pressure in shower but this was minor should not stop a visit ,0
 Unable to access WiFi at the hotel had to go to a cafe to access Limited selection for breakfast As always as a solo traveler I was given an inner room overlooking the courtyard ,0
 Room was on ground floor so very noisy every night and early morning and windows were on to street No full length mirror No extractor in bathroom so room hot Poor lighting in room all yellow and none in bed area Shower is boiling hot or cold no medium temp Complained on check out didn t get anything back more of a oh well look ,0
 There was no dividing door between the bedroom and the bathroom No shower ,0
 We have no complaints at all ,0
 Terrible room was not accurate to how the photos looked at all The room was tiny the floor was dirty and the room was so overused and old I could not believe how much we paid for such a horrible looking badly kept room ,0
 We stayed 5 nights booked a winter garden view room with bathtub Arranged to the 1st floor which view was kind of dark and dusty At least not as shown on the photos No door for bathroom so makes room humid after shower Also showerhands was weak hard to being able to take a good bath after long walk The facility varies from room Breakfast was a bummer What matters is the service When I ask staff if there s any kettle Or maybe the cleaner forgot the welcoming water the first day they provided the answers were always Nop we don t have Nop you have to buy it costs 9 euro So are u taking or not I don t think a hotel deserves a 4 star without warm hearts and trying to solving customers needs and provide alternatives My recommendation is that it s no necessary to be equipped for every room but be prepared for some needs That s what good hotel should do Not sure if I was being picky because of this is my honeymoon At least this hotel has rooms for improvement ,0
 very disappointed with the wifi in the room no wifi at all when I was told it was later I was told it was the location of the room that the wifi was not working,0
 Towel racks would be nice ,0
 We booked a deluxe garden view room with 2 single beds What did we get A room that felt like a cave with a double bed no shower and not even a door on the bathroom When we asked for another room they said they were fully booked and gave us a bedsheet and a roll of duct tape to create some privacy for the bathroom When we checked out we were charged the same price as the deluxe room The complimentary water had already had a few gulps from it ,0
 The wifi did not always work there was no hand wash facilities in the toilet the room was a little small The couple in the next room Room number 65 were fighting in the hallway we reported them which stopped it for 20 mins they then carried on for another 1 5 hrs we went out to them on two occasions and told them to keep quiet as it was 1 30am in the morning and they had woken us up ,0
 The shower fittings were very shiny and hard to grip but I gather they are to be replaced in September The overhead shower there was a hand grip shower as well tended to flood the whole bathroom as there was no lip to keep the water inside the shower staff ,0
 Dripping tap in bathroom not a great shower fairly poor breakfast wifi only worked in the reception Overall the staff location made up for both of these minor issues,0
 The breakfast has hardly changed in 30 years except they now add dry scrambled eggs and baked beans Not good enough in such a hotel,0
 Wifi signal not great or consistent The bar and lounge was just some chairs If I wanted anything from the bar someone had to be called Overpriced for what was there My room was in a far corner that was dark hard to see where the keyhole was Room very small Housekeeping left the hose for the vacuum in the hall for most of the daay ,0
 Could be get the coffee machine to work,0
 Coffee,0
 There was a few places that could have used a little more detail when cleaning ,0
 Took a while to get key from night porter to busy on his phone ,0
 WiFi was lousy attitude of staff was at times unpleasant breakfast was unappetising and tasteless ,0
 All OK,0
 The contemporary bathroom sink was terrible in design ,0
 The doors automatically slam when you close them it s a little annoying because of the noise,0
 NAD,0
 Very poor breakfast variety considering the hotel star rating I had no internet connectivity during my stay in it ,0
 Too much deodorizer or scent in the room,0
 expect a better breakfast,0
 Breakfast in Paris hotels is not the best this is no exception ,0

 The size of the rooms and the quality of the Internet were poor,0
 No minibar in the small room,0
 Breakfast was bit of a disappointment ,0
 pretty small room and poor breakfast,0
 Only one thing poor wifi connection,0
 Staff weren t very welcoming and friendly,0
 Wifi is not the best and coffee at breakfast could be better,0
 Patchy Wifi in the Top Floor rooms ,0
 Room really small Bath even smaller and the shower was half broken,0
 There wasn t anything that stuck out as being negative ,0
 Cheaper breakfasts ,0
 Everything was good,0
 Small elevator,0
 Sound insulation between the rooms is not perfect No big deal though ,0
 Some difficulty in getting TV to work,0
 Small room,0
 Small beds small room for 3 people,0
 Perhaps a conversion to English on Tv channels,0
 There is no bidet at the toillete,0
 Location is really convenient ,0
 Limits on coffee provided Had to request additional tissue ,0
 The room too small,0
 I met some friend at the hotel and each of us had a different rate price the Gap was big ,0

 late checkout only available for almost a full night s fee ,0
 Small rooms are very jammed There is no minibar or kettle in these rooms ,0
 Room is bit small and the bath tub wasn t practical at all ,0
 N A,0
 The doors of other rooms closing was a bit noisy Some weird edges and trip hazards in the room ,0
 None Whatsoever,0
 Bathrooms are a bit of a trial,0
 No room service no bar,0
 Marginal wifi only real irritant,0
 The price of the taxi to the airport totally over rated ,0
 Wifi connection was terrible,0
 All the staff showed great help except the old reception man in the morning shift 14 july 2017 he was not cooperative at all and he ruined my morning I hope the manger will do something to improve his attitude ,0
 Stuck in a lift for 20 minutes no stuff member came to talk to me or assure me Was told to wait for at most an hour imagine I was suffocating in that small lift I was rescued by a friend who came an opened the lift The technician arrived after 45 minutes Terrible experience The technician who answered the bell could speak French only Hotels should have technicians for a crucial thing as a lift on standby ,0
 The lack of a spa was surprising given some of the other high end hotels in the area,0
 The room was warm We slept fine but usually like the temperature a little cooler but enjoyed our stay ,0
 Forniture of the room is quite elegant but old aged If you want to drink something at night you must go out because the bar closes before midnight ,0
 There is no lobby in the hotel that is a problem entrance is too small and the door opens and you are cold there when you are waiting for some one ,0
 The laundry charge was too expensive I feelt like I m being overcharged somewhat ,0
 Not much not to like perhaps the carpet in our particular room could use a good cleaning quite a few stains The light system was a bit overly complicated to use and it is unnerving to have the lights go completely dark while one is in the restroom ,0
 The room had a lot of dust Sad to see such wonderful furniture lamps in need of a good dusting That is my only negative comment Staff was excellent They were the best ,0
 The room was long and the windows were positioned so high we couldn t look out of them ,0
 The front desk staff very condencending less helpful They called me thinking I have ran away without settling accidentals and the were speaking bad things in French unbeknown to them my colleque understood french Bad considering the rooms were paid only 30 for water and tourism tax ,0
 Beautiful bar restaurant that they closed bcs of low occupancy we believe Paris is strugling after bombing attack However instead of cutting cost they should invest in guests that do visit their hotel so they return Wrong service mentality ,0
 Breakfast could be much better and bigger but than again French are not known for big breakfast buffets ,0
 Everything was to expectation ,0
 So much dust behind the nightstands that I sneezed the whole time I was in the room Definitely not a 5 star hotel also didn t feel safe to leave valuable goods in the room ,0
 They didn t clean the room for 2 days we had to tell the reception The room was not very clean the carpet was very stained For the money we expected nicer ,0
 Room was a bit dark but other rooms probably are not If the rug were changed the room would have seemed like new Bathroom was very large and nice ,0
 There was no restaurant bar lounge or proper concierge on duty a fact of which I was not informed until we arrived and were pointed to the cramped cafe across the road In a week of rain and cold having to leave the hotel for every meal was not acceptable The room was compact with the shower within a high bath and on one occasion only one yowel given to us We ended up having breakfast inour room on a tiny table huddled like back packers This is definitely not 5 star ,0
 The housekeeping and cleanileness is zero The service is below average for a 5 star hotel There are very few options for food from room service and the restauraunt was closed The furniture is really old compared to what I saw on the website Not child friendly at all wifi was bad ,0
 Wifi went out TV went out No ice machine they made beds but didn t clean the room Breakfast was terrible and room service was twice the amount of what you could get right across the street ,0
 Some rooms not that good,0
 No Window,0
 No fitness No sauna,0
 Room was not clean very old style and very not like the photos on the website Highly disappointed for a supposed 5 star hotel ,0
 The toilleteries in the bathroom ,0
 Not much Would like some more varaiety on breakfast buffet ,0
 Water had chlorine in it and affected my hair,0
 nihil,0
 Staff friendly but not helpful,0
 Food smells in the left,0
 The quality of the room s internal finishes is not a five stars level ,0
 Buffet breakfast was too pricey so we went out There are many Parisian breakfast options locally ,0
 Nanny service sometime we this for our small children,0
 Staff excellence,0
 Corridors boiling hot leaving the room aircon struggling,0
 Smell in the room dated interiors,0
 I had a fold up bed,0
 Room without a real window They charged the room twice on the credit cards and did not pay back yet,0
 It would be great to make a small reparation,0
 worst bathtub placement windows can be bigger room needs more daylight ,0
 High quality breakfast buffe but with limited choices Very small reception,0
 The worst 5 star hotel I ve ever stayed in ,0
 internet connection was poor ,0
 none,0
 Arrogant staff ,0
 Hotel completamente obsoleto ,0
 The restaurant bar,0
 Room was very dated and small ,0
 many things Bed in living room internet wasnt working during all our stay etc,0
 small room tired looking,0
 Wifi connection is the worst and hardest to connect,0
 hotel is quite ols and needs to be modernized ,0
 the room was too small the bed size was very small no tea or coffee maker at room the staff wasnt friendly,0
 Bar was closed for renovation ,0
 Every thing the service is so bad and poor and the breakfast also so bad the room is so bad very old furnuture,0
 Fairly bland business hotel but excellent value and location ,0
 Would have been nice to have breakfast however at E29 per person was way beyond our budget ,0
 The hotel doorman was the rudest and most incompetent staff I have ever met I asked him to call me a taxi for the airport and he got me one coming after 20 Minutes While there was a line of taxis right at the corner Having seen that I asked him to watch my luggages time for me to see if I can get another one at the street corner the man refused saying I am on my own Finally I went with my stuff and got the taxi immediately since 10 of them where queuing Worst groom ever ,0
 No food after 11pm at the bar but yes as room service,0
 Hardly any vegetarian options,0
 Very discourteous staff except people at the front desk Rooms too small Beds uncomfortable Housekeeping and service staff rude,0
 Bar service was a bit uneven given that it was the end of the evening and they appeared to have been very busy before They recovered though ,0
 Their room service I asked for tow empty glasses to my room they told me I will pay 5 or I can come myself to take them from bar and this what I did ,0
 The food options available under room service were less But then again it is so close to some really amazing cafes and restaurants at Bercy that one can quickly step out to grab a meal if they do not want to leave the hotel ,0
 Other than for breakfast Restaurant didnt open for other meals during 4 night stay Mould build up in showers is a dead give aeay when it comes to house keeping standards,0
 The rooms are little old The breakfast is OK ,0
 Breakfast very expensive although an excellent buffet with lots of choice Hotel probably more suited to business travellers Hotel restaurant was closed on the Sunday evening I stayed ,0
 We some problems with the cleaning staff not coming back when we left the card on the door saying to come back later Or if we left the card stating to do not disturbed we were interupted ,0
 Price of room service city tax added at the end of the stay even though we paid it via booking com ,0
 Cleanliness of the breakfast room ask your staff not to put bread clumbs on the floor as at the end of breakfast at 10 30 am the room does not like very clean ,0
 When we arrived they told us that our booking was canceled but I did not get any email from booking com And they arrange another room but because of availability we had to pay extra for upgraded rooms whic were available ,0
 The toaster in the breakfast room was not working very well but that was all We struggled to find out where the car park was to park the car but finally pulled into the hotel and were helped immediately ,0
 Offered room upgrade for a charge which we took As we were checking in for only one night at 7pm a complimentary room upgrade would have been nice gesture Part of upgrade was free mini bar but there was no alcohol Just one beer a small bottle of wine would have been nice ,0
 It would be better if one more blanket can be provided in the room ,0
 More choices for Halal Muslim Food TQ,0
 Little bit far from main attractions I e the eifel tower But there is good cheap bus services right outside ,0
 We didn t like the fact that when we arrived at the hotel to check in we requested to give our credit card in order to block 360 euro for guarantee This was something that we have never been informed for before Also This caused us a big inconvenience because we didn t have this money available for our holidays At last it became much more difficult as according to our bank s policy this money will be released in 25 working days ,0
 There was a noise from what sounded like to room next door humming like air conditioning through the night The mirror in the entry was not clean ,0
 The staff at the restaurant absolutely missing service education doing comments about other customers bad welcoming at breakfast ,0
 Could not change my booking from twin room to Standards room since it was booked through a website Very unhelpful service and quite arrogant The holding fee on my credit card was hold for 2 weeks because the reception staff forgot to release the funds ,0
 My own stupidity at getting off the wrong Metro Station IT s NOT BERCY Metro its the next one my bad not the hotels,0
 Bed was a tad soft Staff removed the mattress enhancer for us which made for a much more comfortable sleep ,0
 A C,0
 Would be nice if there was a pool ,0
 Not much We drove this time and parking charges are quite high in the nearby public car park so a deal for hotel guests would be nice ,0
 Too far away from champs elysee and Eifel tower about 30min with metro I think it is time for renovation However a nice hotel ,0
 The only thing that this property could use is a pool That would be the only thing that put this property over the top other than that there are no issues ,0
 Restaurant close at 11 00 pm and if you like late dinner you should order from outside ,0
 Sofa in a broken state and not meeting the standards of the room,0
 The employees at reception desk seemed very busy and a bit artificial I did not feel they were very interested in the guests ,0
 Liquor prices Baileys Irish cream is way too expensive compared to premium whiskeys Ie 1 oz of Irish cream sells for 10 Eur compared to 1 oz of glemorange whiskey 13 Eur Knowing that that bottle of whiskey costs 4 times the bottle of Irish cream Dosage price should be reviewed relatively,0
 The price of a bottle of wine in the bar was ridiculous 44 euros ,0
 Food is very expensive and parking at hotel is 30 Euro a night which I find way over priced for staying in the hotel Gym is extremely small could do with more leisure facilities especially with kids ,0
 They did not change the bed sheets for the 6 nights and not able the cab park next to the main entrance I fell in the stones of the entrance,0
 Location is far from central Paris I lost my charging cable for my camera inside our room ,0
 room not set up for a woman unable to use hairdryer in bathroom assume for safety reasons so I had to plug it in by the desk No mirror near any of the outlets so had to use my FaceTime camera on my computer to look at myself while I dried my hair Located in a business center neighborhood while there is a metro line close by that goes straight into town without stops that s no substitution for being able to walk out the hotel and take a wander in the neighborhood That would not be recommended in this location not scenic and sidewalks walkways especially difficult along the Seine Unless you have business very close by this would not be the hotel for you Gare de Lyon is an arduous 30 minute walk if you walk fast and it s really difficult if you re hauling a suitcase even if it s small Of note when using Booking com you will not receive loyalty points you only get the points if you book directly That is really low ,0
 Very strong air freshener smell in hallway on our floor,0
 Our stay was too short ,0
 Little oversights here and there We were a group of three friends staying in one room but the extra bed didn t get made with the same fabulous comforter and they only provided one robe and slippers for the three of us Upon request an extra blanket was provided but not a proper comforter And I m sure we could have gotten extra robes as well if we had asked Another friend stayed in one of the upgraded rooms with a nespresso machine but the room hadn t been stocked with nespresso pods and it required a call to the front desk A very good place overall as I said it was just little things here and there that keep it from getting an even better score ,0
 TV in main room didn t work Lamp in main room didn t work Lighting wasn t the greatest broken lamp taken into consideration Fridge wasn t stocked up daily Valuable item of clothing went missing from our room,0
 Tables for two at breakfast are a little too close but if you are in a bigger party you are more likely to be seated at one of the circular tables in the centre of the room Bar service is extremely slow on our third visit we actually gave up waiting ,0
 On arrival despite booking a superior double room we were given a twin room on Valentine s Day When we went back to reception to tell them they had made a mistake the receptionist s quick solution was to say can we push them together for you Top marks for thinking on he feet but NO Eventually got given a different room two floors down The Bathroom towels were stained and dirty marks on the ceiling in the bathroom room service was very slow and the champagne glass had a chip which was very sharp We were informed breakfast was served until 11 00 on checking however on Monday when going down to the restaurant at 10 10 we were ushered away saying they were closed as they were only open until 1100 at the weekend 26 per person The iron in the room was broken this was replaced but the old one didn t get removed and got kept in the corner of the room Hoping this was only a one off ,0
 I have seen 2 hours after your confirmation that you wrote nonsmokers preferred Therefore I wrote promptly a mail to you DIRECT to your mailadress with the exakt Name and date of booking and I want both rooms f r SMOKERS Sorry to say i did not receive ANY answer When we arrived the booked rooms habe not been available at 14 00 and not the following days and they habe been Nonsmokers From your really friendly personal I received no comment to this All other services have been pleasent and professional ,0
 Paper cups for tea coffee facilities Asked for better cups twice both times where given more paper cups No fresh milk No creamer Asked again was given more coffee sachets At these rates I expected better ,0
 Price of food and drink very high Breakfast although a good choice the hot food was luke warm to cold There was a mouse running around the bar,0
 There s just one elevator to reach the gym 1 level no stairs and it might therefore take a while in busy times when everybody is going to upper floors,0
 Heating didn t work in room problems with wifi tv didn t turn on minimal assistance from staff in response to queries about sightseeing etc Mistake in check in info supposed to incl breakfast,0
 Not much to dislike ,0
 We were in room 528 facing south and the main road Very very noisy,0
 Front desk staff was incompetent we had friends and family calling the hotel to get in touch with us but the front desk operator gave info to our friends that we had not arrived yet and that our reservations where canceled And that there where no body in that name at the hotel In spite of us staying at the hotel wrong information was passed on he also had no clue who the guests where Totally unfit for the job ,0
 It was very noisy in our room due to traffic noise,0
 I have stayed there 3 times before there seems to be no record or continuity no way that they recognised me as being a customer who had stayed several times before that was disappointing,0
 We had a double room in a corner of the floor that was large enough but only with a small door sized window in the corner room 901 if I remember well This was not as booked online ,0
 A little far from City Center,0
 they have to add more items for the breakfast,0
 We booked 2 separate rooms through booking com This had not been communicated correctly with the hotel and only one room was ready on arrival The staff were very apologetic and dealt with this straight away There was then confusion on check out as to if the room had been paid for We didn t have any nice views from either of our rooms The location of the hotel is in a business district type area ,0
 Only staying for three days ,0
 Would have been nice to have a pool within the hotel ,0
 The wifi in the rooms could be improved The signal was very weak in our room ,0
 Everything okay ,0
 The sofa cum bed was uncomfortable for the kids to sleep The rain shower is the bedroom upstairs is too close to the wall Kept banging my head into the hand shower Location is a bit off for leisure travelers ,0
 We have been reserved in certainly adult 3 rooms when I went in the afternoon at 3 pm in hotel that there was only bed for two person in the room Although many times expressed in desk and on the phone I want to room change for 3 persons as the contract but it did not have to change Even after been eating dinner there is no subject to change at all I m very angry So I said Why do you sell this room tricked into three rooms to two room for me Finally changed the room for 3 persons contain in extrabed But heartfelt apology is not visible It is very uncomfortable experience to me about Paris ,0
 It is not near the places for tourists but with Metro using it you can come over this problem ,0
 The food and alcoholic drinks were so overpriced that it was actually cheaper to eat and drink in nightclubs and high end restaurants than at the hotel The breakfast buffet constantly ran out of cutlery glasses and soft drinks Often they were never replaced until the staff were asked The rooms had very low wardrobe space and hardly any clothing hangers Some rooms had international plug sockets while others did not Some rooms had windows that could be opened while others did not ,0
 A member of our group drove to the hotel the price was advised as 25 upon arrival the fee was 32 on the machine and then he was charged just short of 70 Even though the concierge advised that he would not pay this I will be in contact with the hotel regarding this excessive charge On a minor I was disappointed that soy milk was not available at the breakfast ,0
 no facilities at all in the room almost unbelievable no kettle even,0
 Strange mattress toppers meant feet were raised,0
 Far from many tourist atraction places,0
 Missing folks spoons and knifes during thebreakfast every day ,0
 The water was very slow for a bath It took for ever to get enough water for a bath ,0

 The room is so small It is not like in the picture However we are used with rooms in Paris The elevator stops at the middle of 2 floors so you have to walk up or down to access your room It is quite strange with us ,0
 Mini fridge was missing shower is a bit tired and room had absolutely ugly color ,0
 The elevator stops at strange half floors So no matter which floor you re getting off at you have to take a few steps up down on a narrow staircase to get to your room ,0
 Expensive breakfast Buy it on the coffee roastery at the corner of the park instead ,0
 Small room and the chairs made it smaller Fact were no hooks in bathroom no herbal tea and no tea cups or mugs ,0
 Frankly we don t understand how this hotel has a 4 star label This should be 3 at most Rooms are very small the hotel itself is a bit old the elevator stops between floors so you still have to take a few steps and it is also ridiculously small we could not fit 2 people with our two suitcases and we are small Oh and WiFi was terribly slow as well ,0
 reception staff grumpy very poor breakfast not at all a 4 star level hotel,0
 it s probably the Paris standard but the triple room was incredibly small overpriced like hell,0
 The small size of lift And the lift stops in the middle of 2 floors needing to take stairs some heavy luggages ,0
 dark in corridors and small stairs Very small room selected and paid for a double room but got a single room No security chain on inside bedroom Some of the Staff at reception or breakfast staff almost inexistant Disappointing for a 4 star hotel It is a good 3 but not 4,0
 Breakfast was ridiculous If staying at the hotel please don t pay for breakfast as you WILL be disappointed There is a fabulous restaurant around the corner from the hotel two minute walk it s called Vertigo The food was great ,0
 I called down for a charger and iron the man on reception asked me to come collect it i explained I was in PJ s and he said what do you want me to do Then another man walked into my room at the crack of dawn Used a key so presumed must have been staff but this woke me up and obviously was quite frightening I told reception the next day and she seemed particularly unmoved by this simply said he must of been staff Finally as we left the staff were standing right outside the hotel entrance smoking Generally unprofessional quite rude and would NOT recommend ,0
 The room was extremely small It would have been acceptable as a single room but not as a double room The bed was extremely small and it was attached to the wall on one side and a small passage on the other side I am not sure how it can be called a double room ,0
 Breakfast was a little chaotic got down 35 minutes before it finished but we had to ask for all the basics as it was v poorly replenished Airco didnt work so bed room was really very hot The bathroom was tiny which is to be expected in Paris but was just one more thing ,0
 For the price I could not find fault ,0
 Rooms too small for 3rd bed which was a rather uncomfortable sofa bed leaving no space to lay out a suitcase Parking was difficult ,0
 The rooms were small but functional If you are looking for lots of room to spread out this hotel is probably not the best choice If you are going to see the sights and just need a clean comfortable place to sleep this is a great option Since we had a toddler it was slightly cramped but that is my only complaint ,0
 The Room we took was a bit small for 2 people but was big enough all the same ,0
 The pictures I got in my reservation do not belong to the room I got I reserved a superior room and it was quite small I asked the receptionist what is superior in my room and she told me that is the view to the park that makes it superior I felt disappointed It took hours to the staff to prepare scrumble eggs ,0
 Not conveniently located from the airport or in to central Paris It is eother 20 in a taxi to central Paris or a 90 min walk The room was unbelievably small and It comfortable for three people in the family room I paid 150 for one night for a family room but it was not comfortable no small luxuries and not ideally located The fire alarm went off early in the morning which disrupted the breakfast routine We were dragged out of the hotel very early because a chef burnt some toast and set the alarm off From then on there was insufficient breakfast on the counter and it took us nearly an hour of waiting for toast and eggs to arrive Overall I was very disappointed with the hotel Please don t stay here ,0
 The value for the money wasn t that well The location wasn t good for the money The room was Tiny ,0
 Please booking personal must be check all things then presents they in to booking web sit ,0
 The pillows are very soft which I don t like and there isn t any milk in the room if you have a craving for a cuppa after a long day ,0
 The room was small with a disappointment view it was on the 1st floor but it felt like a basement We had the view of a wall and all the air air conditioners outside In the silence at night we could only hear that annoying sound of them working ,0
 Only a welcome information about the surrounding area would have been really appreciated ,0
 The room was a little smaller than we thought we did have a lot of luggage The location may be a little far out for a first timer who wants to walk out of their hotel into the thick of things in Central Paris ,0
 Could hear people talking outside until 2 am every morning Had to open window because room is too hot Room was very small along with tiny bathroom Probably could have found a better hotel for the price ,0
 Tea bags needed renewing but this a minor point ,0
 A good coffee machine would have been great ,0
 industrial extra small croissant no proper breakfast area Breakfast is served in the reception area with uncomfortable inappropriate chairs sofas and tables Very limited choice of breakfast items espresso is charged extra Only 20 French TV channels ,0
 Rooms are a bit on the small side but very comfy and clean,0
 Noisy heating the bathroom was nice but there should have been at least a table in there You have nowhere to put your stuff ,0
 Slightly cramped room had to duck past TV to get to loo in the night ,0
 Breakfast could be improved with fresh products and real coffee ,0
 The room is small but it is Paris after all It is not accessible to people with disabilities or people with infants and strolls The breakfasts is OK but too simple and not French authentic ,0
 Reception wasn t good place I didn t like their responding The lobby was quite small There were no television in there Anybody doesn t help you to carry your luggage and show your way The escalator was horrible It was like an service escalator Only two persons can enter in it Esclator doesn t go to your level You have to climb the stairs with your luggage Coridor of flat was very narrow There was no refrigerator in your room If you want anything your room they don t bring you There is no room service They say you come and take yourself The tv shows only French channels The breakfast was insufficient I didn t understand how this hotel rated 8 2 points l defently don t suggeste this hotel for staying,0
 Breakfast was little bit expensive ,0
 I almost had a heart attack when someone walked into my room at 8AM They didn t knock they just opened the door it was very scary The hotel didn t seem very concerned about the situation and I had to practically drag an excuse out of them ,0
 Surprised that for that price there was no mini bar and the furnishings were unremarkable ,0
 Elevator stopped mid floor so it was necessary to walk up or down flight of stairs with luggage ,0
 The room is quite small but this is Paris you won t get a large room here The elevator is also really small but it gets the job done ,0
 The lift was extremely small and transporting suitcases pushchairs up and down from our room was a bit of a pain ,0
 Not enough light to use the mirror in the bathroom for makeup and nowhere else suitable Used compact mirror in the end but it us not comfortable Only 2 tea bags The receptionist provided more on request though ,0
 The colour of the paintwork and walls was very dark in the room we had and the lighting quite poor especially for reading No telephone in room and we had to ask for coffee and milk each day as this was not provided only tea bags ,0
 No problems just a bit of confusion over some extras on our Bill in French which were quickly and efficiently sorted out ,0
 Not getting pick pocketed on the Metro in the first five minutes of arriving in Paris ,0
 Drink making facilities Paper cups provided for hot drinks Only one teabag provided at a time No milk unless requested No information provided in room about hotel facilities or nearby ameneties ,0
 The photos of the room were not reflective at all of the actual room were in There were stains on the sheets Rooms were extremely small ,0
 Grumpy staff at check in In Paris I ve had similar facilities room size and amenities and closer to metro for 20 lower price ,0
 Breakfast could contain more protein and please serve fresh boiled eggs every morning old ones taste bad but otherwise great experience and we will return ,0
 No milk to accompany the tea and coffee making facilities provided in the room until we asked ,0
 The smell upon our arrival probably coming from the bath Hotel was very small rooms also but it was ok ,0
 Very small rooms although contain key things one migh need Breakfast is overpriced however tasty It is vegetarian predominantely continental so might be too small for those expecting full breakfast ,0
 Only one English speaking TV channel and that was US news No clothes storage except hanging no drawers or shelves Paper cups for coffee had to buy our own,0
 The bathroom was freezing cold and no heating could reach it The breakfast is not worth paying for Ugh No greens and all sugar ,0
 A new employer unable to do her job at the reception was nasty to me It was the days of the terror and I asked if the trains were leaving to Italy or not cause they said frontiers were going to be closed She answered to me that she was busy hotel was in fact empty cause all afraid they left and that it was not her business to phone or find a solution for me I never found a concierge like this and I have travelled for more thans 20 years She even said that dogs are not welcomee there and that I cannot come back with them So I called the other genius employer named Moussa in his day off and he helped me in every one of my doubts and solved all the problems this unpolite inefficient unprofessional caused ,0
 the room was small the bathroom was very small you barely can wash without opening the door the window was pointing to a wall,0
 Room was quite small Drab colour scheme Although tidy the room could do with a brighter colour This would also make the room appear bigger ,0
 the rooms are pretty small with very little space to cross from one side of the room to the other the elevator stops between the levels and therefore the rooms are to reach only by stairs the next metro station is several minutes to walk,0
 Room came with Tea and Coffee but no coffee and no milk had to go to reception both mornings to get milk but other than that it was great ,0
 The breakfast room is in the same floor as front desk which is very small I had to wait for a while to get a table ,0
 Not a lot of interesting restaurants within easy walking distance but a very friendly bar on the corner ,0
 Breakfast is really basic and could be improved easily ,0
 The hotel was very noisy people stood on the landings and chatted well into the evening and the doors let the sound in as though they weren t there Also the room was very hot at night but if the windows were open the noises from the neighbourhood were so loud ,0
 Breakfast could be improved easily as it is very very basic ,0
 Even the hotel have a sound proof but i still can hear other customers banging their door It is a bit dark in the room the two spot lights were bright but installed on the top of one side of the room Two beside lamps are too dim ,0
 More breakfast options Please ,0
 room small but great value and we were only in the room to sleep so how big does it need to be ,0
 Double bed was not accessible from both sides fixed against the wall making it difficult for two people to use Staff failed to acknowledge our arrival us with a basic greeting despite us saying good evening and bon soir They also failed to respond to a personal request for some Ice after reluctantly agreeing they walked off and never returned leaving us baffled disappointed ,0
 Stairs are very steep and the lifts stop between floors so access with heavy luggage or reduced mobility is a bit awkward ,0
 Some staff clearly needed more training regarding the operation of the hotel and general organization ,0
 Noisy Can hear guests banging doors of their rooms all the time Twice the housekeeping opened the door and came in room once while I was in shower and once while I was changing ,0
 Perhaps the little bathroom in the could be problem for bigger guests ,0
 No problems at all ,0
 A little bit off But not a problem ,0
 The wifi a bit hit and miss,0
 The bathroom was very compact for my liking,0
 The construction noise outside ,0
 Liked everything ,0
 Dining area at breakfast was small,0
 Dirty bathroom and old,0
 Smoke alarm dragiging me out of bed,0
 Very small room and bath ,0
 Our room was rather small and the aircon failled one night ,0
 Air conditioning didn t work very well,0
 the breakfast ,0
 Oda k k,0
 Rooms very small,0
 Rooms were very small for three of us ,0
 I like the location as well train is very near,0
 Small rooms,0
 No hot water for 2 days ,0
 Everything was terrible,0
 Very small room short bed,0
 Very small room difficult to walk inside without hitting something,0
 Rooms doors are very very bad It makes noisy sound like hell when it is closed ,0
 They could have more variety of the food ,0
 In the bathroom there is not heating and it s very cold Noisy from the street ,0
 Could have provided milk cartons UHT fine and coffee,0
 Room very small,0
 the balcony was filthy and the room small,0
 Paper cups for tea in our room ,0
 There was not one thing to NOT like,0
 Breakfast could have more option ,0
 Loved it all ,0
 one of the beds was lumpy,0
 Room 301 has view on the wall,0
 Double room ideal for one but a little cramped for two,0
 The wi fi connection was a bit slow The room was small ,0
 Bed too short if you are tall this place is not for you Bathroom really small,0
 There is a non stop noise a bit annoying to sleep,0
 No minibar Low shower flow,0
 Photos make the place seem bigger and more grand,0
 Small room they make the pictures look bigger than what the actually are,0
 stairs rather tight lift just to mezzanine,0
 Everything was perfect ,0
 Room rather small for a twin double minute bathroom otherwise excellent,0
 we never made it to the full breakfast when we got up everything except the fruits and cheese was gone,0
 bad parking facilities,0
 Very very small room Sound insulation is very poor ,0
 You can hear people from other rooms loud and clear I couldn t sleep after 7am after the other guests woke up The first guy on the reception was rude and unhelpful ,0
 ventilation is good on the top 7th floor as our room 702 had windows facing in 2 different directions However room 402 e g facing just one side was kind of stuffy ,0
 The walls are thin so it was possible to hear a lot of what was happening in the neighbouring room ,0
 The elevator There are only 2 elevators one of each only reach up to level 2 and the other one is able to reach up to level 7 But the one which can go to high levels is so small and only able to fit 4 persons it also uses for the housekeepers You need luck to be able to use the elevator ,0
 The cleanliness of the bathroom could be improved And the shower was way too small for me ,0
 Though chambre de bonne was very cosy we could not walk up straight in the room because of the beams We also missed a proper wardrobe with hangers and some hooks for coats ,0
 The wifi was slow and sometimes we were unable to use it ,0
 We d appreciate if the staff hadn t referred to us as MadameMonsieur we are two guys even though it s a habit obviously ,0
 Cleanliness They didn t clean the used coffee cups from previous guest ,0
 The shower room is small so water could be everywhere ,0
 We had an unpleasant experience when getting breakfast I was traveling with my 83 year old mother We arrived just at the end of the breakfast hour and although the buffet was still out were told we had to leave which seemed ridiculous as people were still eating and food was there in front of us My mother is very unsteady on her feet and the restaurant manager was totally rude and inconsiderate I complained to management and I believe he was reprimanded They told me that they might offer us a free breakfast the next day but they charged us The manager had changed his attitude though The elevator is tiny and not for the claustrophobic ,0
 See above,0
 Wifi wasn t great showers are also tiny not all rooms have showers which could be better communicated online as people expect a shower as standard Mini bar is limited and fridge not cold ,0
 The bathrooms smelt like cabbage and the halls are very narrow so you can hear quite a lot ,0
 It would be nice if there was coffee served in the lobby served as well As the restaurant is closed during the day ,0
 Narrow bed small windows and dark interior Cold bathroom without additional heating Low ceiling in the room gives the impression of gloomy room Small elevator for 2 people ,0
 Service was terrible we asked if we could have a drink in the restaurant which was empty and we were told only if we were eating There was no other place to have a drink We also asked a number of question at reception and were told someone would come back to us which they didn t And finally we were disturbed by other guests who we think had escorts to the hotel and proceeded to keep up the whole hotel with their activities We were on the 4th floor friends on 5th and other guest we talked to from 2nd floor and everyone was disturbed also by the subsequent arguement and intervention of another guest Several people were complaining at reception however no discount on the room not even a complimentary breakfast was offered The guy in reception was laughing about it ,0
 Very tight space all around Shower cubicle not made for bigger people Staff is uninterested and borderline arrogant Hotel is far from any tourist destinations area not very attractive or interesting If you have a neighbor who smokes your room will also smell of smoke Will not return ,0
 one staff who can t speak English it was always tough to communicate with him and sometimes there s only him i appreciate and feel more secure if he can speak English a bit more ,0
 yes the corridors might be tight but it is Paris,0
 The shower head in room 204 needs to be tightened ,0
 some staff is not good at commnicating in english i asked them not clean my room as i don t prefer someone to enters my room but it was done all day i stayed,0
 The bread ran out at breakfast When i asked for more of the french baguette they told me this was not possible If you can t get a french baguette in france for breakfast where can you ,0
 The drain in the bath room is very bad When I was taking shower I need to control the water faucet in case the water overflow ,0
 we stayed in a superior double which was a lovely room but the wet room did not contain the shower water the water went everywhere except for down the drain and flooded onto the carpet in our room resulting in a very rushed shower We got moved to a suite for the following night because of this issue then found that the suite had EXACTLY the same issue carpet drenched Tiling needs to be more angled to allow the water to filter to the drain hole ,0
 No wardrobe only two shelves plus a metal bar without hangers good that I always have a couple in my suitcase Light was flickering when turned to the dim mode ,0
 Room sizes in Paris are naturally very small The shower area has a very small glass panel and water would fill up the entire bathroom floor as it spilled from the shower area despite a lot of conscious manoeuvring There are no tea or coffee making facilities and I had to buy water from the nearby grocery store ,0
 breakfast was too simple,0
 I was on the top floor and the wifi signal was very poor ,0
 THE NOSIE OF BATHROOM NEXT DOOR,0
 Room phone and refrigerator didn t work ,0
 The hotel room was not very clean,0
 Old lift,0
 Sheet of duvet was a bit dirty,0
 the room was small,0
 The room was tiny ,0
 Small bedroom heating system or thermostat was not properly functioning,0
 one mini thing well you can hear the drain ,0
 some of the staff could be more helpfull a bit noisy corridors,0
 Noice from next room but can t help it in these old characteristic rooms ,0
 No hair dryer in my room though I asked it for the second night,0
 Breakfast wasn t really worth it ,0
 Overly cool staff Rooms not checked for maintenance issues I had to move rooms twice ,0
 Very noisy very thin walls Poor WiFi,0
 Soap was watered down ,0
 The cleaners they couldnt be bothered and didnt even vacuum The Carpet,0
 poor refrigerator in the room almost empty staff untrained poor service,0
 First room air conditioning didn t work internet was dreadful last straw was no hot water in the morning for a shower so left a night early For the money was not expecting the Ritz but could be better,0
 Stayed in the blue quite and Wifi and TV didn t work To be fair I did not mention this to management as most of the time we were out and about Lift is small 2 normal people a very large person would likely not fit nor would large luggage with a person leaving stairs as the only option Shower bath was oddly missing any side glass sheets to stop splashing water hitting the floor and it lacked a holder for the shower head which made showering fun I guess they assumed everyone would take a bath instead None of these were major issues to me hence still giving a very good rating because everything else was fantastic ,0
 The hotel decor was a little shabby in the room bathroom was very basic no shower ,0
 Wifi was non existent we aren t desparate for it but needed it to organise our next day sightseeing ,0
 Room and bathroom was a bit smaller than I had hoped for No bath as requested when booking the room just a shower The smallest lift I have ever seen it is a 2 person MAX or 1 person with 1 suitcase ,0
 Rooms were tiny and not what was advertised as per images Bathroom was tiny and could not fit a male comfortably Wifi was non existent 1 out of the 3 receptionists could speak understandable English Overall poor experience ,0
 Decor was slightly shabby Room was slightly small for the furniture in it ,0
 Hotel is on very best place because this place is very noisy ,0
 Since the suite is at the top floor we bumped against the low ceiling in the bathroom over the bathtub most of the time A bit hard to find via car GPS because Rue Sainte Opportune is not a car accessible road ,0
 Well if you re on a sightseeing holiday it is vital That you plan your next day feom your hotel room Now this was something we couldn t do neither our neighbors from different floors The wifi was absolutely rubbish Many people complained including me throughout the 4 days we spent there But hey reception restarted yhe rooter every time what did not solve the problem promising tje next day it shall be fixed since he s going to pass on our rightful complaint You see we paid for a room with wifi Well they didn t manage to fix the problem hence the full house Really disappointed could have found a better place for that money The other little problem was that after room service always left with one set of gel and shampoo Every day And I ve asked every day for another set One day we only had shampoos Not really thoughtful Overall cleanliness was good tough ,0
 It seemed the room was a little small the shower even smaller you could have used the curtain as a flannel and I am of average build The noise of the revellers during the night was ok but got a bit lively and loud during the small hours Use the stairs as the lift is very small ,0
 Poor wifi non existent mostly and room over heated but we could open our window but then got street noise below ,0
 Rooms are small and dirty ,0
 The room was small The Internet was poor to say the least ,0
 Very small room with and very tiny bathroom In thw shower there was a curtain couldn t feel it clean Photos don t show what it looks like in real ,0
 the room given to us very small The shower cubical is so tight and badly designed that all water spills to rest of the bathroom not much of choice of free tea bags and they even not re fill next day of our stay wifi was very poor and slow i would only give full marks to its location,0
 On Saturday early morning the rubbish bin cleaners outside were so loud it woke us up and found it hard to go back to sleep Wasnt relaxing that morning ,0
 This hotel markets itself as a 4 star and charges four star prices I suspect the French don t use the same standards as everywhere else in the world as this hotel is at best three star There was barely enough room for the bed in the room the wifi connection process was prehistoric with a series of codes for each device that kept cutting out we had to run the shower for 5 minutes each time before the water was hot staff didn t replace the shampoos unless we asked them this is a seriously over priced hotel and was definitely not worth the money,0
 This hotel is for no reason a 4 star hotel The room was very small one double bed could hardly fit in The bathroom was very small as well especially the shower The check in was very bureaucratic you need to fill in a whole form with personal details The internet was slow The place for breakfast is on the basement and seems like a cave ,0
 There was no bar in the hotel not a proper restaurant either facilities weren t that great and the rooms were too small ,0
 Room service not at all attentive mini bar not replaced in 5 days I had to chase them for soap towels creamer etc,0
 I didn t ask for the breakfast since it was expensive 17 euro per person but I could buy food from the 2 supermarkets The hotel assigned me a very small room at the beginning very hot and without ventilation but after the first 2 days I asked to change it and they gave me a better room I booked the taxi from the hotel to the airport and the driver seemed to know the manager of the staff and I was surprised that for 30 min driving he charged 76 euro When I took the taxi from the airport to the hotel I paid 50 euro for the same trip Don t book a taxi with the hotel ,0
 It was really noisy not just from the street below but the walls were thin and you could hear the people next door taking a shower or opening their door ,0
 Internet did not work AT ALL the entire stay Could not control heat either too cold or too hot The rooms are noisy There s no standing shower just a hand spray in the bath Breakfast is a rip off especially with all the restaurants nearby The rooms are super tiny Don t be fooled by the wide angle lense used to take the picture Very few tv channels This is more like a bed breakfast Expect a bed in a good location and no other amenities ,0
 No ventilation in the room and so eventually had to prop window with coat hanger Teabags not replaced and no coffee available in room Front Desk staff men were pleasant but not very knowledgeable Arrival had to wait for him to finish something and then check in was quick but called room number out twice so people in lobby could hear The woman at check out could have been a robot no eye contact no question as to the stay Asked for room number did not confirm with name asked for payment and gave copy of bill no offer to put in an envelope Did not enquire as to quality of stay wish good trip home or invite back any one would have been pleasant ,0
 Wifi servive was tiresome Never been to a hotel where I had to get a new user name and password from front desk every day Half of them didn t even work ,0
 Hotel very nice and comfortable we had a great stsy lovely room however the breakfast experience was terrible we had to wait for coffee and eggs and servce no variety of yoghurt and cheese or ham the tables we had to clean up ourselves and was dissapointed to see only one waitress that neded to serve and do and handle a lot of work she was great and very nice and friendly but sorry to see her without any other help also the room was not equuiped with enough toilet paper and coffeee things lovely hotel but dissapointed to lack so many basic things that we paid very good money for just basic things is not much to expect for the rate of hotel and price paid Hopefully you take the feedback on board Would not hesitate to recommend hotel but please get the basics right,0
 The fact that we had to log onto the WIFI every time we came back to the room was slightly irritating but only a minor issue really ,0
 Our room as are most rooms in Paris a bit on the small side for four adults to be completely comfortable Our teenage boys got a great deal of enjoyment out of the spiral stairway to our 4th floor room The rest of of squeezed into the two person elevator a true luxury in this part of Paris ,0
 Photos depict a much higher standard of hotel than reality Good location but in quite a noisy area especially if on the front side of the hotel The smallest lift I have ever seen Bath tiny and although there was a shower attachment you physically couldn t stand to shower due to the angle of the ceiling see photo ,0
 The room was minute you simply couldn t enter carrying your suitcase even a small one You had to go in sideways or else climb onto the bed to enter the room And a little soundproofing would be welcome as it s located very neat a number of noisy late night bars ,0
 No access to hotel with car if driving Pack light Tiny lift fits 1 person 1 luggage bag bloody inconvenient when traveling with young kids and big luggage ,0
 Toilet and bath room was not clean wifi was extremely slow and disconnected several times that is worth in upper floor ,0
 Our room was called a junior suite but was basically a bedroom with a second single bed stuffed in a niche right next to the large bed Fine for my mother daughter and I but lacking in privacy one might expect with a suite The public areas of the hotel seemed a bit worn While the location was central and convenient it lacked in charm Though very close to the Marias which is full of charm ,0
 The location can also be busy so if you want a super quiet place don t stay here having said that the double glazing and sound proofing is excellent so after having a few drinks and enjoying the local surroundings you can go home in a few mins and not hear much at all Shower was small and not the best water pressure Not a huge deal for me but may be for some ,0
 Wifi connection problems due to room location as wifi works well in hotel in reception area,0
 Room bar fridge had a really bad smell which staff were quick to clean it still smelt after and cleaner was happy to do it a second time It still had a bad smell so I defrosted the fridge and cleaned it myself ,0
 I had a great roof top room with an excellent view of the quaint Parisian rooftops surrounding but unfortunately the room only has a bath tub with no shower ,0
 This hotel does not have the room sizes facilities or services you expect from a 4 star establishment even in Paris At best this is an average 3 star hotel It is totally over priced as a result The corridors are narrow 75cm and continuously crowded with hotel maids dirty laundry and cleaning equipment The room food service is sourced externally and therefore takes ages to be delivered The beds are hollow and the pillows too hard resulting in back and neck aches The Wifi login is cumbersome and cuts off periodically At this price the breakfast which is served in a basement room should be free in Paris it is cheaper anyway to go to a nearby street caf ,0
 everything was good I could not wish for more,0
 Very expensive for the room size bathroom was very small and missing some showering items Very small and slow elevator ,0
 What wasn t so great was the photographs of the room had suggested the suite provided two separate bedrooms this was not the case Additionally there were problems with the electricity where we had to turn on wall lights in order for sockets to work When one set of sockets worked others switched off ,0
 Wifi extremely poor,0
 Little bit expensive ,0
 Small room with a small window,0
 Smalll room,0
 The room was tiny and worn out even in Paris standards ,0
 Wifi doesn t work tv remote doesn t work room is the size of a rabbit hutch,0
 Wi Fi did not function Aircondition did not work Faucet was leeking quite a lot,0
 Rooms were slightly small ,0
 wifi in the room was bad,0
 Rooms could be bigger,0
 Price too high room too small very noisy only one slow elevator ,0
 Door handles lights didn t always work ,0
 Slightly outdated otherwise basic comforts were good ,0
 There was not much got good left at breakfast ,0
 Slow internet connection,0
 Room a bit small for the money,0
 The lift was very narrow and hardly contained the baggage ,0
 There are some rooms located at another side with Windows facing the back alley Terrible ,0
 Rooms are extremely small as well as bathrooms Breakfast is poor ,0
 Shower bath not user friendly,0
 small bed for couple,0
 There were machine noises during the whole night I could not stand in the shower due to the roof ,0
 Noise from the other rooms,0
 no thing,0
 Internet access was unreliable and staff had trouble fixing it,0
 Room size,0
 The room was cosy especially the bathroom,0
 The internet wasn t reliable in the rooms so not good for a business traveller ,0
 Need to log in for wifi when return to hotel every time Some rooms can t access wifi ,0
 The cleaning wasn t great ,0
 Tiny rooms ,0
 My bed was a bit soft ,0
 Had to come home,0
 no complaints,0
 Very small bathroom shower,0
 I had to shower bent over in my attic bathroom,0
 Breakfast buffet was not replenished staff not very attentive ,0
 4 stars and 300 for a Tiny room and very Bad breakfast Do not recommend ,0
 Can be a little noisy shower not brilliant,0
 Toilet wouldn t flush ,0
 Our hotel room was a little small The bath had high sides and was difficult and dangerous to climb in and out for showering Definitely a no go for anyone with mobility issues The separate WC was tiny and a squeeze to get into and close the door A wall telephone was place at hip height so often knocked on in error We didn t receive nightly turn down as expected and raised this with the hotel ,0
 The lobby of hotel is crwodied with so many people and looks like market they should adjust the movement and the ambition of the hotel I booked one night and the management promised me for extend one more night but next day they change their mind for no reason else they should care a bit of room cleaning ,0
 I was appalled by server who refused me to sit at the dinner one evening stating that i did not nook for donner despite that i told hom i was staying at the hotel It took other servers to give me a table Clearly it was not an issue of space or lack of food it is somply that he did not want me to be served For someone who paid more than 4000 Euro this hotel needs to select its employees as this is a very bad sign,0
 Free wifi is unacceptably slow And the paying high speed option is more a scam than a service In the year 2017 in a 5 star hotel you re simply supposed to offer high speed wifi for free and calculate the costs in your overall rates A minor but tedious flaw in an otherwise perfect stay ,0
 The room we got at the beginning was a first floor corner room which is kind of out of our expectation because we were there for our honeymoon and I booked the room ahead However the staff were very helpful and we did upgrade to a very nice room with a little extra cost ,0
 was quite upset to see trash can in bathroom was not emptied when we checked in ,0
 The wifi connection was not very strong and it was hard to stay connected for longer than 30 or so minutes But it was free so I was able to post to the blog to let people know how I was doing and how my 60th birthday was ,0
 Installation in room very noisy sounds like someone in the room above was vacuum cleaning all night it kept me awake the hallway and elevator is smelly next to my room was a service room where someone was smoking cigarettes in the morning the smell of cigarettes came into my bathroom ,0
 We ate in Le Lumiere and were very disappointed It was very casual and really just like eating in a bar The staff did not seem well trained at all The food was nice but very expensive for the type of place where it was served The glasses of champagne were very expensive and the wine list extortionate ,0
 The hotel felt a bit outdated The checkin process takes longer than expected The hotel actually checks the Credit Card provided by charging 1 Euro before accepting the booking They said that they usually returns back the euro once the client checks out That s bad At breakfast eggs was charged extra ,0
 The hotel is starting to look really run down I was really looking forward to staying a plush hotel The ceiling is peeling wall paper peeling the bathrooms are due for renovations ,0
 No real complaints the only thing if something negative can be said the storage space in the room was somehow limited ,0
 I saw a few features that could be refreshed But it is a busy hotel in a busy city so I am sure the maintenance has already be scheduled ,0
 No cons come to mind ,0
 Toilet outside of the bathroom without a faucet and the small size was uncomfortable Breakfast was expensive ,0
 It is a bit pricy for winter and the room will be tight for two people,0
 Tiny spaces and corridors mediocre spa and health club The bell boy s and the men who stand by the entrance seem little rude ,0
 The housekeeping was a bit sloppy as towels and coffee for the coffee machine the used cups and drinking water was not replaced in the night ,0
 My daughters were so spoiled by everybody I had to found good arguments to get them out of the hotel ,0
 The fitness center was limited The bathtub as in a number of hotels is high and can be challenging to get out of Grab bars would help ,0
 the shower Instead of shower curtain I have seen the half covered by glass type of thing but you cannot shower will full blast without wetting the floor I do not understand why they have this kind of thing Different culture in how to use shower ,0
 Step into the shower is quite high and it would have been nice to be informed prior to arrival that the walk in shower was only available in certain rooms at 40 euros extra per night ,0
 Staff could miss you in the little alcove upstairs in in tea lounge so you had to go back down to get their attention ,0
 We should have stayed longer ,0
 very bad welcoming There was a guy at the reception who was very rude They changed our rooms multiple times because of availability On our day of our departure the bellboy forgot one of our suitcases because the hotel was pretty busy we had to miss our train and lose 400 euro for coming back to get it ,0
 Tripe room was only a camp bed so a little cramped in room prob should have known ,0
 Bed a bit lumpy big dip in mattress Hotel needed prompting to bring extra towels and amenities when the the room was for 3 people not 2 ,0
 Having to come home,0
 Very soft pillows when asked for firmer pillows staff brought more soft pillows have found same problem at Sofitel Wentworth in Sydney One lift out of service out of three not enough to move guests quickly out of very small lobby area Great Nespresso machine in room was appreciated but not enough pods or milk housekeeping brought us more but I think it always looks a little penny pinching especially in a 5 star hotel when only just enough is provided for one cup of coffee ,0
 Room a little old fashioned Shower screen inadequate Irrespective of all the positives the nightly room charge is still formidable ,0
 I had an unpleasant incident in this hotel Some money from my wallet have dissapeared when I left it in the hotel room The hotel s manager considered that is normal for hotel s guests to be stolen I had been left with a bitter taste after this hotel accommodation and of course with the manager s apologies I Recommend to the future guests to take care of their personal things in this hotel ,0
 Superior room is tiny If possible get an upgrade Bed is a little too small as well Room looks outdated Wifi is to be renewed every day ,0
 The initial room allocated did not meet our expectation The staff member involved was unable to resolve the issue but the customer service manager more than made up for the issue see below Overall a very pleasant stay ,0
 Due to COP21 it was sometimes difficult to find somewhere to sit in the Lounge It was also a little annoying having to negotiate the Press in the Foyer ,0
 Hard to get a seat in the bar reception area because it was full with the IPCC conference people All staying in 5 star accommodation with large entourage and limousines Climate change ,0
 Well everything ok just a bit expensive,0
 We booked for three adults room in addition to one doubl bed room However the extra bed was too small for 20 years old boy ,0
 the room is a little too small for a superior double room room 565,0
 The hotel is not really luxury as I am used to It is more a 4 star Quite old ,0
 Room too small table too small,0
 It s nice place s and the hotel self also nice,0
 There was problem in the shower,0
 Size of closet no space for a dress,0
 Bad Lots noices from other rooms ,0
 The gym is too small ,0
 Limited breakfast for 5 star hotel,0
 Delay in getting access to the room,0
 All was fine for me,0
 the prices are very expensive for coffee and breakfast over the top ,0
 I liked everything,0
 Not really,0
 Not value for money,0
 Location was super friendliness of the staff and the comfort of the bedding,0
 shower is somewhat uncomfortable as very small in a bath tub,0
 No getting breakfast with room,0
 Big TV set but very poor choice of channels ,0
 Wifi speed,0
 The SPA needs significant work,0
 Room service was very slow and the beers served by them were always warm ,0
 The room was a bit on the small side and it was quite expensive,0
 Bed wasn t the best,0
 The gym is terrible,0
 Rooms to clean at 1500 is a little late Walk away n showers rather than baths,0
 The room was on the back side looking directly to another room window one meter away I asked for room change and was refused unless I paid more,0
 The facility that was not enaugh ,0
 Shower in the bath tub was unconfortable ,0
 Small bathroom,0
 Bed was very lumpy and sloped to one side,0
 Mediocre service and friendliness for a 5 star hotel ,0
 view from room,0
 I wish we could have stayed longer,0
 More choice in the cafe menu ,0
 Gym was a disappointment it s really not a gym ,0
 the room was very small,0
 The gym is upsetly small And it s slightly overpriced ,0
 No complementary water,0
 Spot lights right in front of window ,0
 Fasility not much then that oder hotel ,0
 Rooms not luxury as it should be Very unconfortable mttress,0
 a little too much information at breakfast,0
 Room service needs fine tuning Towels brought in at 10 00 pm and litter cleared at the same time Bed not made ,0
 We checked in too late We arrived at noon our room was ready at 6pm,0
 Cost,0
 Staff,0
 There is no cupboard,0
 Can be very expensive Drinks and food are especially expensive,0
 Gym is very poor Too small and poorly equipped ,0
 Breakfast was not included in the price a pity ,0
 Room is so stingy Staff s not polite except the taiwanese girl at reception she is helpful Conversation with a male staff at reception on phone after checked in Me hi can i have 2 sets of tooth brushes please Staff sorry it s 10pm now and the housekeeping is closed Me huh Closed I thought hotels provide 24hour service Staff where did you read that we provide 24 hours service Me Me i need two toothbrushes it s just basic request I know it s 10pm but i just checked in Staff yea but we are closed it s 10pm Me ,0
 No sweetener only sugar for hot drinks in my room Hairdryer was hard to use as you had to constantly hold the button down for it to work ,0
 A room with a bath would ve been nice but we didn t put in a specific request so that was something on us ,0
 ice machine is not working in the corridor staff refused to bring to our room We requested for 2 beds and was given a room with 1 bed Coffee machine and safety box were broken Housekeeping should have checked the amenities before letting traveler to enter the room ,0
 For a 5 nights booking we got one single soap in the bathroom Breakfast is too expensive In the morning starting at 7 30am the house keeping crew starts knocking in the doors very laud waking uo all the guests around Its so easy to improve in my dislikes lists that its even strange that its not fixed yet ,0
 We were upgraded to a executive room which was very nice but the room was for 3 originally we booked a double bed a pull out bed so not much room in the bed,0
 Dirty carpet and cobwebs on the ceiling the electricity cut out in the room for a bit we asked housekeeping to clean the cobwebs and nobody came,0
 Breakfasts and tea could have been hotter ,0
 bar staff were extremely slow food took over an hour to arrive with no apology bedding was not changed until 22 15 after calling housekeeping 3 times ,0
 On arrival the male member of the reception team didn t seem to want to check us in and was only available to help after the female member of the reception team had welcomed us and call us over to check in ,0
 I appreciate that they manage to achieve the high price point hence it remains at sometimes eye watering levels but in a market where the offering doesn t vary from Novotel location to location in fact this one doesn t even have parking it really does apply a very high premium ,0
 Poor signs for main reception near the main entrance maybe should be a notice on the ground floor near the other reception that is only for package holidays saying main reception to hotel is on the 1st floor The room was a little shabby not as advertised on the website ,0
 We had booked for a one night stay to attend a concert in the area and the receptionist that checked us in rather than say that the booking had come through with my surname as my christian name and that I was male he proceeded to imply that I was not the person who had made the booking despite the fact that they had all my details just round the wrong way This attitude was unsettling and angered my partner who tried to contact the hotel group that Novotel belong to only to be told that because the booking was done through booking com there wasn t anything they could do which was surprising and indicates that their system for receiving bookings from other agents needs reviewing and their staff trained better to deal with potential errors To make matters worse when we had lunch in the bar and tried to put this on our room bill we were told that the same receptionist had not authorised my card for this facility and had only taken payment for the room Authorising cards on check in is standard practice in my experience therefore I m not sure why this was not done as it meant all additional purchases had to be paid for separately Although this situation was not resolved we were at least offered two free drinks by way of an apology after making a complaint The contemporary decor seems to disappear in the rooms The bath was actually just a shower as it had no actual taps and was small The water ran hot and cold intermittently For some reason having upgraded to a superior room the sofa bed was made up as two single beds and when we tried to restore it back to a sofa we were only able to retract half of the sofa The aircon was poor to almost non existent however the weather had been exceptionally hot but would have expected the aircon to be able to cope ,0
 We stayed overnight to visit Wimbledon and asked in the morning before we left for Wimbledon if me may leave our car in the car park until we returned at night The very friendly girl at reception said yes no problem just come in at night to validate the ticket When we returned a very hapless young man took ages to validate the ticket moving from computer to computer and finally telling us we would be charged 37 50 We found this very steep and frankly were very surprised to be charged at all If we had parked in a parking garage off site we would have paid around 20 If the parking garage had been full we would gladly have paid extra for our parking but it was virtually deserted Paying just under a 130 for the night for a basic twin room we would have thought parking would be included or at a very reduced rate The breakfast in the morning was excellent with very friendly efficient staff ,0
 The entrance is designed for coaches and while it is not far to walk to the tube station it is not a pedestrian friendly walk due to the entrance design being at the furthest away from the most direct path to the Hammersmith tube and some construction poorly designed pathway and coach parking at the entrance level Also the hotel is so large that you may need to walk a long distance to your room this was okay for me but if you have a lot of luggage or trouble walking long distances you might want to know this ,0
 Whilst the room was very comfortable and all the amenities that I required were there the poor condition of the carpet was quite apparent It was tired and worn out ,0
 Staff could be more attentive and friendly Overall the stay was nowhere near value for the amount paid Toilet paper in bathrooms was poor Room dining choice was poor Expected more in provided room facilities considering the room price paid such as caffeinated coffee only decaffeinated provided a few more biscuits etc Ultimately the room was not much better than a Travelodge but at least double the price ,0
 The cost of parking was ridiculous at 36 per day No information prior to going on this cost They say they don t run parking but it s under there hotel It would have been cheaper to take the train I only took our car as I may have needed to go somewhere further afield ,0
 The rooms and hallways indicate that the hotel is not so new ,0
 Staff,0
 Breakfast was expensive for 2 37 ,0
 Our room overlooked a building site The Scrambled egg was under cooked Had to pay full price for breakfast even if we only wanted cereal and toast Would be nice to have a choice between a full cooked breakfast at the full price or a lighter breakfast at a lower price ,0
 I booked a Superior Room I think this just means it has a sofa Minimal bathroom toiletries minibar not stocked although it came in handy for keeping water and snacks cool no hotel information provided in the room It was just a bit underwhelming And it wasn t cheap ,0
 Air con broke and we had to ask twice for someone to look at it and never really got fixed Standard of room was very average for executive whatever it was We asked for a room away from building works and they put us in a room right next to it ,0
 Poor response from reception re cancelling breakfast They wouldn t allow it as booked through booking com I e mailed booking com who responded by advising me they had communicated my request directly with hotel To date I ve had no response as from hotel Very very weak ,0
 Rooms outdated and noisy No air con only fan so room very hot and stuffy in summer and no sheets thick quilt only Pillows were terrible flat Expected more for the money,0
 Umm I have stayed a few times now over the last 18 months I stay there because it s close to my elderley fathers flat and I go to see him The superior rooms are a little tired Bathrooms have mould on the fittings Carpets tend to need a bit of a clean This time the door into the room looked like it had been kicked hard at the bottom and the lock was loose I did tell the reception staff when I checked out Executive rooms tend to be nicer but are a lot more expensive I don t tend to eat there as the breakfast is so expensive ,0
 Staff at reception cold when checking out no greetings or courtesy Bathroom below average Not worth the expensive rates,0
 Lady who checked us in was rather rude and unwelcoming not the best first impression to give Breakfast was a bit hit and miss hard pancakes very runny scrambled egg and tea pots could do with a serious scrub Also the tea and sugar supply in room was a bit stingy only 2 teabags and 4 sugars which is fine if you drink coffee too as there was plenty of that but sadly I only drink tea ,0
 One of the other reasons we choose this hotel was it stated in the details that the hotel had air conditioning it does not its rooms are air cooled We stayed on one of the hottest nights of the year and had an extremely uncomfortable night We complained in the night and the next morning when we were told the rooms are air cooled The hotel gave us two complimentary breakfasts and took our bar bill off the final bill as compensation for our unpleasant night Thank you Novotel It would be worth checking with the hotel and altering the incorrect details on your website ,0
 No air conditioning in room Fried eggs greasy Only one toaster working and it took x4 goes to brown the bread properly ,0
 The fact that was told the mini bar was free due to the upgrade but it was in fact completely empty Housekeeping service extremely slow to take calls and to respond I also reported to main Reception that someone had vomitted on the carpet in the corridor near my room An hour and a half later I had to report it was still there I walked past it 3 times to and from breakfast which was very off putting to the appetite and on departure ,0
 The smoking terrace was woefully neglected the morning after a Friday night of drinkers and smokers I know that s not a higher priority as most people don t smoke but we do ,0
 The booking was messed up and the staff and managers could not have cared less At midnight they were still arguing about our needs To top it none of the staff in the breakfast room understand plain English Want oats Forget it they have no clue The food generally was poor but I asked for fresh fried eggs and got rubber eggs that reminded me of army food 30 years ago disgusting Oh did I say the staff are shocking I hate the staff at the this hotel with a passion when we arrived I said to my wife I will be staying here in future when I visit London After staying there I will never go back Did I say how bad the staff are Shocking ,0
 The room I stayed in was very tired it needed a through deep clean and everything updated I have stayed in much better hotels for half the price There weren t any other rooms left in the hotel so I could be moved but I checked in at 1am and just wanted to go to sleep as I needed to be out of the hotel by 7 30 Also 27 for a cooked breakfast get in the real world ,0
 Didn t think it was worth the money but it is in London ,0
 There was strange smell in room especially when the bathroom was open 2 out of 4 lifts were out of order all the time Our key to room was blocked before the time we should leave the room This hotel needs total renovation ,0
 In the first room we were allocated there was a distinct smell of vomit near the bed We told reception and got moved In the next room only one plug socket worked and the air conditioning was broken which made the room like a sauna and meant neither of us could sleep We were headed to a wedding so hwd to dash else we would ve asked to be moved again Beds were not to taste too hard When we got up we were bitten to death by a flea it wasn tthe best ,0
 Bedside tables a little too small to be practicable ,0
 The bedroom had not been cleaned smelt and someone had laid on top of beds Our room was changed so there were no twin bedded rooms one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed At 8 30 a m someone opened our bedroom door believing it was empty The tap pushing in the plug was broken and came away The bath was narrow The sheets and duvet cover was of poor quality ,0
 The fact that our room was on the third floor and so far away from the lifts The carpet makes it hard to pull our trolley bags and the distance to the lifts which was on the other side of the building as mentioned was too far The windows looked out onto a roof I did ask for a nice view However I was told that the twin rooms were all on the third floor and that was the only view ,0
 Not even bottled water in the room bit sparce although the kind receptionist did say next time to ask and she will make sure it s provided,0
 The room was awful It looked like an nhs room it was awful and for the amount it cost i would expect a lot more I would also expect things like a shower hat in the bathroom ,0
 Bathtub size too high for short people to step over no face washers supplied only one small soap for two people for shower and hand basin,0
 Breakfast was awful and over priced They need a better chef and more choice in pastries etc,0
 Bad smell room from elevator elevator very slow with long que waiting two days without make up for the room no one bottle water at leat served as complimentary or chargeable In addition staff was bot flexible to cancel one night ahead of time and insisting that booking should request so Underground to center of London requires train changes ,0
 The only downside was in the bathroom this whilst showering the water as one would expect you placed at a setting comfortable for the user during showering the water temperature did alter from the original setting to being very hot to cold not what I was expecting However once you got used to this you could manage the changes in the water temperature,0
 Smell from sink of sewage air con wasnt very good Outdated ipod dock that fits old style the coffee machine pump seems to be on its way out as very very slow Very noisy people slamming doors all the time Bedside plug did not work so to find my phone fully flat in the morning,0
 This remark is made in the certainty that finding a pleasant outlook from every room of a large hotel is far from easy that said I found the view from 802 interesting only because I was able to carry out a quite unscientific census of the numbers of A C units that had sprouted on London roofs since my last visit ,0
 The bed the broken air con the fact that there was no extract in the bathroom,0
 Staff gave out a key to my room to a complete stranger who then moved in and hung his clothes next to mine in wardrobe and put his toiletries next to mine in the bathroom I returned to my room late evening to find all his bags and stuff intermingled with mine and I was horrified No one at reception answered my calls and I had to get a very kind man in room service to go to reception and make them call me Had to move rooms in case weirdo came back Horrendous experience hotel system failure ,0
 Even though we cranked up the AC 5C in our room and maintenance checked it twice the room was hot Apparently their system was not ready for AC to be ran yet as it was not summer Maintanance guy was crabby when he showed up Their mini bar refrigerator did not chill drinks enough It only contained 2 bottles of water and they were barely colder than room temperature ,0
 Ventilation in the rooom was very poor We had no sleep down to malfunctioning aircondition and one cannot open windows properly to ventilate ,0
 Bathroom was in a poor state of repair unable to empty bath as plug device came off in my hand Poor state of grouting in places leaving opportunities for dirt bugs to lurk ,0
 When I arrived I was informed that I had been upgraded to a premium room and so was looking forward to seeing my room The room decor is dated and certainly not luxurious Could do with refurbishing the bedrooms or ones similar to the one I stayed in in keeping with the rest of the hotel ,0
 The hotel is old and in need of a major renovation Non of the electricity sockets were working The soap was not replaced ,0
 Our room was over looking the flyover and close to the railway which operated all night ,0
 Silly thing only 2 teabags in the room that s it ,0
 TV could have been upgraded to a smart TV in this day and age ,0
 the water for tea and coffee was cold I asked 3 different members of staff for a hot cup of tea and coffee All that happened was they came and topped up the urn with a jug of hot water pouring on to the cold water in the urn the staff member then kept trying to light the small pot under the urn Myself and my sister in law where taking our 95 year old mum for a follow up appointment after having heart surgery a month ago I requested a accessible room for mum as she can not walk far we were given one room with a double bed when we requested a twin room and the other room over looking the flyover We were then moved to a twin room which was as far as could be from the lift this was a real struggle for mum to walk to the lift The only helpful person was a young man in the restaurant who got us a wheelchair for mum as we did not want to make her move rooms again the checking in took for ages and the young girl who did this only gave us one room although i gave her the booking form sorry to say she also had a body odour problem some one took over from her after about 25mins this was quite stressful as we had been travelling for 3 hours to get to the hotel very disappointing for a large chain hotel ,0
 The staff very rude girl squeezing lemons at bar looked at me like a peace of dirt while being served at he bar the boss stopped the barman to tell him instructions of jobs needed doing and I was waiting to pay for my drinks milk in room was out of date curdled my tea disgusted at the charge of water in the room and the breakfast was over cooked food and they shut the second buffet early to prepare for lunch so everyone using one buffet so big ques and scraps of food left waiting to check out poor system people wer jumping ahead of us then staff on iPads serving people behind us took 25 mins for us to be served poor service poor hotel and I ve been to a few and never felt the need to write a bad review,0
 Parking is very expensive even when you are a resident in the hotel Lifts were a little slow ,0
 Car parking charges were unexceptable we stayed there for 3 days and were charged 1 50 per hour which totalled 108 I think a day rate should be set up for hotel guests not an hourly one ,0
 Temperature in the room to stuffy bed ok only 1 pillow each television sound didn t work properly bathroom old fashioned not a good selection of toiletries no shower cap room not cleaned first night so no tea coffee milk ,0
 Eating in the hotel was expensive we didn t have breakfast there for that reason and the buffet we had one evening was ok but pricey for what we got We would have preferred to eat in the bar that evening but the bar area is very small for a hotel of its size and we couldn t get seats ,0
 Staff doesn t respond quickly The room lacked cleanliness Water system not working properly Tap water smelled like sewage We requested changing the room but no response The shower was bad also Too expensive for what they offer ,0
 rooms are in need of some tlc,0
 Very dissapointed with our room although location was good as had some skyline views we were next door to the ice machine and until early hours of the morning we could hear people talking whilst using the machine Our room temp was uncomfortably hot the shower in our room was varying from cold to scolding hot making our morning shower far from pleasurable I had to leave washing my hair not at all pleasant I did report this to the reception but little was offered in compensation I feel for the price of our one night stay the whole visit was displeasing and not worthy of a higher rating than a premier inn ,0
 The view from the room wasn t perfect but it s hard to see how that can be improved Also we were only there for 1 night so it didn t really matter,0
 The extortionate parking cost at weekend given that there is no charge for on street parking at weekend across from hotel The appalling amount of litter directly outside entrance to reception,0
 Rooms are NOT air conditioned It is a cooling system that did not work Day 1 Complained and they said a technician would have a look 6hrs later on return to room had to complain again before technician came who clearly knew it wasn t working said he would have a look at it the next day and brought a fan Fan didn t help it was so warm in room Complained again and they moved us room It was cooler Day 3 Returned to room early evening after a busy weekend only to hear extremely loud music Complained 9 30pm to be told it was a wedding in function room and they couldn t do anything about it It would end 11pm but we could move room Advised I had already moved room but if finished at 11pm I would put up with it 11 15 complained again music even louder Was told they would go have a word with organiser 11 35 complained again Was told I would get a call back 11 45 a different member of staff called back saying the event was on until 12am I like music but I don t pay to stay in a hotel room and go to bed to listen to two and a half hours of loud banging music On leaving in the morning staff were very good at apologising but that s just not good enough ,0
 Returned from Sting concert to bar Toilets female x2 one without loo paper and other its handle wouldn t flush at approximately 22 00 hours on 09 11 2017 The staff were woefully slow waited 20 minutes to be served 3 behind bar and 6 patrons waiting to be served and no bottled water behind bar to take to room ,0
 The room was superior and the hotel is 4 star I was expecting a better quality more spacious more commodities and newer in comparison with the reception entrance area and outside ,0
 Carpets throughout the hotel had a funny smell and seemed to be in need of a very deep clean or replacement ,0
 Maybe to be offered a top sheet as well as a duvet ,0
 Second stay here and if I d have had this same experience the last time I stayed I honestly would have stayed in a premier inn and paid far less Room was dated in need of a major revamp the room was filthy with tea stains up the wall The bed was rock solid and uncomfortable and the pillows were awful worst nights sleep ever I requested to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was packed and Given that last time the room was lovely and I had no trouble I suspect they were at maximum capacity and using rooms they wouldn t normally All in all I wouldn t recommend this place and never intend to stay again ,0
 The only downside to our stay was the price of parking at the hotel considering we were guests of the hotel and paid a significant amount to stay the one night I would of thought we would of had a better rate on the parking Our car was parked in the underground car park for under 24 hours and cost us 36 I just thought this was very expensive and if I had previously known the price I would of considered parking elsewhere ,0
 Parking charges We had two rooms and when we checked in we set off to our rooms to find one occupied and one unmade After return to reception and room swap we had an uncomfortable night down to poor aircon A complimentary breakfast was provided with an apology but this doesn t make up for our experience The hotel above L1 needs a good refurb in my opinion ,0
 The bathroom was disappointing for a 4 star hotel shower didn t drain well possibly not as hot as it could have been looked a bit tired The tea and coffee in the room could have been better ,0
 Hotel is very crowded so expect delays to be serviced for any activity check in out breakfast lift hotels in London use to be very expensive this one exceeds many of them ,0
 The REALLY noisy building works which started over the road at 8am in the morning and are going to be there for a LONG time I mentioned it as I checked out when they asked if everything was OK Oh yes the receptionist said we know all about that shame they hadn t bothered to tell me before I booked in ,0
 No minibar Lights in room couldn t be dimmed either on or off ,0
 when I booked online I requested a room with a view when I arrived I was offer a upgrade with breakfast inclueded my upgrade was over looking a building site great view wanted a lay in after a concert but 8am was woken by the noise so I shower with only 1 complementary shower gel to share between 2 went down for breakfast to be told I hadn t been upgraded and breakfast wasn t include wanted 17 50 for a breakfast disgraceful as with the cost of room smaller then expect for a superior double and with food and drinks at the bar I spent 275 reception wasn t helpful and I wont be returning anytime soon,0
 Our room was not cleaned once during our stay Also kettle was faulty and ended up blowing a fuse so the Tv and fridge stopped working ,0
 Floor so slippery in the shower I took a nasty fall Had to ring down fo bathrobes Brekfast while adequate too much walking around with plates drinks nd toast etc Fried eggs as hard as charity ,0
 Room was very small Mini fridge in room but can t be used even for your own goods without paying TV volume limited to VERY low Rooms look re done so lots of weird stuff like latches on doors that can t actually be used walls seem very thin in that you can hear a LOT of neighbouring noise ,0
 We could clearly hear every conversation from the adjoining rooms Both days we woke up because of our neighbors discussions ,0
 price food couldnt find correct light switch toiletries provided minimal despite having an exp room,0
 Room would need sound proofing top to bottom We could hear guests in the next room using the toilet Kids running round in room above ours from 6 13am in morning until 12 00pm at night Kids also running up and down corridor and in and out of their rooms which every time loud bangs from door closing I understand families with young kids who probably really excited too and have every right as others when in hotels my kids weren t always teenagers but respect and consideration for others is something I was taught as a youngster and passed onto my kids too I had been looking forward to a break away from home Just my teenage daughter and I on this break to see a gig The Apollo a bit of normality after my daughter has been seriously ill for some time but to be honest we came home more tired than when we arrived I did bring to managements attention and the best that was offered was another room but was a room with an access door to another room where other guests would be To me that wouldn t have solved a problem We weren t given any details of facilities available to us either A few minor problems when we checking in as my dad was paying for us and no physical card with us after an hour or so management did sort everything but no info of times or where go if we wanted to get breakfast Just left to get on with it We ordered a Continental Breakfast to the room 13 95 per person which honestly that bad didn t order again next day While checking out we got told by staff about the buffet style breakfast we should have opted for in the restaurant same price Info not shared by anyone House keeping need to double check their cleaning methods Our table still had wet ring from cup I was drinking and biscuit crumbs from that morning still there when returned early evening The container cleaning powder was left in the bathroom though where it was used I couldn t tell ,0
 Hair in the bathroom which again confirm me the UK standards 4 hotel are way below v other countries This hotel in Italy for example would be considered a low 3 hotel Also the hotel way out is at a lower ground floor leading to a parking in a dodgy area Not very cool for a Novotel ,0
 Only got one pillow bit uncomfortable The key didn t work one of the nights so had to go get it redone ,0
 difficult to get taxi when going out in the evening reception called and was informed it would be 30 40 minutes We walked up to the high street and hailed a taxi,0
 Well to be honest it was all very good But spa and sauna facilities would be amazing ,0
 the bathroom looked lovely but the shower was very weak,0
 The fact that there wasn t a designated smoking area closer to the room and I had to go all the way outside from my room which was a long way And I got woken up at 9am when check out was at midday ,0
 I think their could be more options on the room service menu not a very wide range in food or drinks ,0
 One Lift out of order so had to wait a little longer for other one but not a major problem ,0
 Bar service for drinks was slow There was a conference and one feels that better planning by the hotel would ensure adequate number of bar staff working ,0
 Trying to get a lift you were waiting for ages we took the stairs a lot but was only on the 3rd floor I imagine any higher this could be an issue ,0
 The carpet and sofa was a little tied looking so definitely take slippers ,0
 Rooms are tired need upgrading Extractor fan in bathroom didn t work neither did the hairdryer and speaker Awful smell in room probably from filters in central heating aircon They need to up their game on maintenance ,0
 Breakfast was additional to our booking we thought it expensive and found somewhere more reasonable We had to ask for our complimentary coffee and tea in the room to be replenished The kettle still had water in it from previous occupants ,0
 I expected more for the money The executive room was pretty basic one bathrobe and slippers between two of us Difficult to communicate with some of the staff as their English was so poor Bar area not big enough for the capacity ,0
 The only thing we had a problem with was there not being enough milk in our room for drinks and the restaurant was a bit too expensive for out tastes,0
 It was a little further away from the Olympia than I thought but was a nice walk Lifts were a bit slow at times ,0
 The room was shabby and drab the carpet was stained and grubby and the furnishings were not comfortable Also there was only one socket in the room to use for any electrical items I expected a much higher standard from the Novotel brand ,0
 Had a long wait for the porter to collect baggage out of the luggage room then he couldn t find out case,0
 No faults at all,0
 I stayed two weeks in the hotel LIFTS WERE A HORROR Only few of them working Always crowded and you never know whether they take you up or down I was taking stairs instead living on the fourth floor but I can t imagine those staying on the ninth floor to do it A hotel is a bit worn out some refreshment of furniture and renovation would be welcomed Horrible toilettes that were splashing out water even with the closed cover I had problems with getting hot water few times There was only cold water running down the shower ,0
 Breakfast is overpriced better to use nearby facilities at the underground station if on a budget Could give a better free biscuit with the tea and coffee ,0
 The rooms being so small The dark alley that you have to walk down at night to enter the hotel a little pricey to not have breakfast included and small cold rooms ,0
 Would have liked poached eggs No mirror in the bedroom to sit at the desk dressing table to dry your hair ,0
 Shower wasn t fab just the type of shower not powerful enough The lifts stopped on every floor in the morning when I went down for breakfast and returned and on most floors there was no one waiting for lift ,0
 Chairs in the room could be a bit more comfortable Entry on ground floor no sky sports No shower mat in room No biscuits in room,0
 No bath bathrobes or slippers in the room as was stated on my booking This had to be requested told housekeeping closed then one bath robe brought to room at midnight Not even two or any slippers Only explanation given was that we were upgraded however did not meet the basic standard facilities as posted on the booking page Disappointed facilities were not all in there for such a big price of 149 for one night ,0
 it was full both nights we were there and so everywhere was crowded Checkin took a while The restaurants wre heaving Had to go early to beakfast otherwise wouldn t have got a table quickly We just really didn t like how crowded and busy it felt,0
 Late night early morning noise from other guests Room adequate but a little bit tired ,0
 Shower head couldn t adjust Very slow WiFi and electricity when charging Lack of wall sockets near bedside ,0
 Fairly basic and room was very hot Air conditioning was broken so temperature couldn t be adjusted ,0
 Terrible sleepless night due to other guests partying Woken up at 3am still people walking halls talking loudly at 4 30am YOU NEED SECURITY WALKing THE HALLS SATURDAY NIGHTS ,0
 Smoke alarm in room went off at 11 50pm for 5sec just enough wake in blind panic but no actual Alarm Man next door coughing non stop in the morning it was from about 6am both days started to feel sorry for him ,0
 Staff were helpful but as English wasn t their first language this was a bit of a problem The hotel looks tired and needs a refit The layout is strange reception on the first floor not ground floor Rooms are small and feel like a budget hotel We wouldn t stay there again ,0
 Only one thing to mention Please check your electric watter kettles in rooms when watter is boiled and you fill up te cup each time boiled water leaks on to the surface They probably should be changed to new ones Thanks ,0
 My only issues were breakfast was a set price of 17 50 regardless of how much you had As someone who eats very little in the morning this was not good value Also the bar stopped serving food around 10pm despite it being advertised as up to 11pm,0
 Th room was fairly basic for what was billed as a 4 star hotel The bathroom certainly didnt meet 4 star standards Hammersmith is practically the end of the line so there was an awful lot of travelling on the tube but it was easy enough Parking shgould be free even with the discount it was far too expensive ,0
 Superb hotel fantastic staff really enjoyed our upgrade and the complimentary drink fantastic view lovely room will definitely return thank you so much Novotel,0
 Shabby decor rooms are painted white on what looks like 70 s woodchip wallpaper The tacky plastic flowers planted at the main entrance should of been our 1st clue Poor quality of bedding with wafer thin pillows Possibly the cheapest toilet paper I ve ever experienced in a hotel of this price range Very noisy even for London We were woken at 7 30am on a Sunday morning by staff wheeling trolleys full of what sounded like glassware we were on the 4th floor followed soon after by regular chambermaid trolleys rolling up and down the corridor with clunky wheels The sound between rooms is also easily audible Staff look bored and the Bar Staff give you the feeling that they re waiting for a better job to come along to whisk them away When I did comment about the issues I had at the front desk it was met with an oh well shrug of the shoulders and hasty preparation of my bill I ve had better stays in Premier Inns and for 200 a night I would seriously look elsewhere ,0
 The carpets was clean but think it could do with a change as lots of marks stains ,0
 Internet was a bit hard to log on to issues with shower the water pressure was too low and sinks were clogged ,0
 Only one small issue with sockets not working in room but was very quickly resolved by staff popping up to our room with a replacement key for an alternative room Great service ,0
 Slightly confusing entrance system on 2 levels ,0
 Not at all sound proof so didn t sleep well Rarely saw any staff ,0
 As we are all big tea drinkers would have liked more tea bags ,0
 The surcharge for the mini fridge for a 300ml bottle of water of 2 75 is VERY EXCESSIVE How about two free bottles of water ,0
 The only minor thing I would say which isn t really a criticism just a side note the breakfast food wasn t labelled so it was tricky to determine of the sausages were non vegetarian or not and you couldn t be sure of the flavour of the pastries but it all tasted lovely anyway ,0
 Construction just outside window vibrated entire room stating at 7 45 each morning Bed wasn t great as far as comfort ,0
 Bed was too close to the wall so knocked knees feet on the wall when getting up during the night,0
 Booked a double room Was given a twin and had to complain So called Superior room very basic and hence overpriced for what it is Staff great Restaurants good ,0
 Construction work outside hotel was very noisy but I guess this only temporary AC not working in room so very cold night but staff very helpful and moved us to another room ,0
 There was a very long queue at Reception to check in although the staff remained cheerful and did the best they could with the resources they had Loo roll was in short supply ,0
 I appreciate most of the reception staff are international but sometimes my ol ears just cant understand them But they are very polite perfectly attired and smile genuinely so Thank you ,0
 We were charged for twice as many rooms as we booked and are now left chasing around for documentation to prove that this occurred 20 minutes on the phone only to be told that I have to prove that I have overpaid The hotel took no notice of my booking confirmation from booking com Who made the error certainly not me but I am going to have to wait for an age to get my money back ,0
 Everything was perfect even if our neighbours were a bit noisy ,0
 The finish in the bedroom walls looked cheap The bathroom looked old and when we ran the bath water the water was dirty that came out ,0
 There is a large and active construction site across from the hotel rendering the noise level occasionally higher than the standard urban level And as is sometimes the case in large capital city hotels there was a large group of still tipsy loud and poorly supervised young adults teens dominating the lobby the day I arrived Still that was par for the course ,0
 Minor issue In Room 9026 the overhead showerhead needs descaling London s hard water has caused some of the spouts to be blocked It s not unusual ,0
 Room furnishing is more like a 3 star hotel,0
 First impression of entrance area doesn t do hotel any favours felt like a basement Shame because it is a lovely bright place once you suss it out Lift to reception all a bit confusing Whole of that floor could be better laid out ,0
 For the 185 for 2 nights a Breakfast included would have given far more value to the deal As a friend of mine was staying in a hotel in Russel Square slightly cheaper but breakfast was included in price For me that was a big let down I do not think I would book with Novotel because of that clause ,0
 The rooms are not well cleaned Initially we have given a room which had annoying construction noise but when complained we have given a room on the other side with no noise The room was very hot due to the heating system been controlled by the hotel Water was only supplied on the first and last day of the stay thought as I understand should be on everyday Bed sheet was changed based on request ,0
 the service from the kitchen 45 minute wait for a minute steak in Ciabatti REALLY little things on customer relations really like getting the attention of the staff in bar for table service more interested in bar service than serving tables also after meal they don t ask if you would like anything else or a coffee you could be making more money and leaving the customer feeling like they have been attended to rather than serviced The breakfast buffet was almost plastic in its appearance a little chopped parsley on top of the scrambled eggs would be nice and well the poached eggs looked like a frizbee and tasted pretty much the same staff setting up and cleaning tables next to you in the rush to get ready for lunch takes away from a leisurely breakfast experience,0
 The bed was very very soft Being 6ft 8inc a lot more support was needed didn t get a great nights sleep ,0
 only there one night and didn t fine anything objectionable while staying there,0
 The room was quite cold and the heater didn t seem to make much difference even when on full,0
 The reception on the first not the ground floor Very pricey but that s London I guess I paid literally half the rate for a similar hotel the next night in Glasgow ,0
 Only the too soft bed ,0
 Felt breakfast was a bit unorganised but enjoyable all the same,0
 Was advised parking was 15 per night but is actually 1 50 an hour This is the resident rate which you only get if you validate at reception although no one told us that and we had to go back or pay 67 Breakfast was poor quality and chaos ,0
 I would have preferred softer and thinner pillows ,0
 Restaurant food lack of local knowledge at reception poor English of several at reception noise in corridor most especially expensive parking,0
 Building works left the hall to our room dirty Decor to room could do with a refresh Bed hard Only 1 pillow Water splashed out of bowl when flushed Only two teabags ,0
 We d asked for milk for the room which didn t come but this was a very minor problem,0
 Taxi cabs are not available at the hotel had to go onto the High St and down to Hammersmith pain on a wet day Breakfast is far too expensive at 17stg Gr,0
 Poorly signposted from road Reception staff could barely speak comprehensible English On arrival the receptionist chose to check us in on the guest side of the desk and faced away from us throughout so it was almost impossible to understand a word he was saying Supply of tea bags milk in room were stingy Rooms were characterless ,0
 Room was needing a bit of TLC some fixture and fittings a bit loose tatty but ok ,0
 I had two stays in Novotel West London in the past 2 weeks 8 2 days In general my staying was very disappointing The main problem was the noise from the construction site next door Starting at 7am finishing at 6pm Monday to Saturday It was really annoying to get awaken by construction machines every day Other nuisances There were not enough power outlets only in one side of the bed and no USB ones One of the rooms I stayed had only 5 TV channels other one had 30 You need to re log into the wifi network every day which was annoying and unnecessary Toiletries were not consistently provided we went days and days with no bar soap or moisturiser Room temperature was not pleasant we had to open the windows to have some cool air into the room Breakfast for 17 pounds was crazy Last year I stayed at Hilton Kensington and I think it was much better value ,0
 Long walk to room Exits slightly confusing,0
 checkin agent confirmed a double bed when we found a twin in the room slow elevators overpriced bad room design light switches shower ,0
 Very loud music going on til after midnight that stopped me sleeping even when I was on the third floor Rooms clean but very basic only one pillow And 2 of the sockets in the room didn t work ,0
 Shower very basic and the water temperature could have been hotter,0
 Had to wait around for porter to leave baggage with Cleaning staff knocked once before entering room to see if we needed more water could have knocked a few more times,0
 Only the elec lights worked in my room Kettle TV H dryer plug by TV all dead As I only occupied the room for 7hrs to sleep I just had to cope no time to complain get it sorted All VERY inconvenient I reported it to the desk as I left The room was 4029 I think,0
 I walk with a stick and my room was a really long way from the lifts The ice machine wasn t working and the mini bar was empty The pillows were very hard and quite uncomfortable ,0
 Complementaries in bathroom bit sparse would have liked body moisturiser cotton buds cotton wool ,0
 Only two tea bags in room and very little milk Had to ask for rubber bath mat and extra pillows as there was only one half size pillow on each bed arranged a taxi at the check in desk at 1230 for pick up at 1740 this did not arrive until 18 15 and traffic was so bad we had to walk a long way to our destination,0
 The shower took a while to warm up and there was an issue with the food in Saturday but the staff are really nice It just seems a little over priced ,0
 shower and bathroom dated and not terribly clean on the shower screen Left wine bottle behind curtain ,0
 breakfast was good but it can be improved room as in all London not so spacious for an executive room,0
 Had to call security as there was a disturbance on my floor keeping us awake all night and coffee machine didn t work,0
 Having to wait 25 minutes for tea coffee at breakfast ,0
 The room was really hot and air con just seemed to blow out hot air Our room key didn t work had to visit reception 3 times before it was sorted this took awhile when you are on the 7th floor Wouldn t go there again ,0
 Coffee machine in room didn t work and wasn t attended to Apparent failure of hot water boiler meant tea late at breakfast Restaurant appeared to close 25 minutes early on Saturday evening but alternatives were offered and food and service at the bar were good ,0
 We wasn t told that there was a building site just across the way so not a very nice awakening Would of liked the choice of Bath or shower ,0
 The approach to the hotel is dark and potentially dangerous when wet and without lighting There were street lamps on the walkway but they were never lit There was also a lot of rubbish around which I feel a good hotel would have taken responsibility for cleaning The worst part room 8003 filled the jug on the espresso machine from the bathroom tap it came out bright green soapy with bits floating in it It also had a sewage smell not nice to brush your teeth in Reported to reception twice after it was still smelling horrible the next morning They said they would report it and get back to me by email which hasn t happened I kept a sample of the water in case we became ill Very disappointing service for the price ,0
 Check in very slow lady who checked us in said sorry and that she upgraded our room but when we got to room was no upgrade we had paid for a superior room anyway Also parking was very expensive ,0
 breakfast expensive coffee maker bottle not clean hair found on bath room tilewall right after when check in ,0
 Bed was bit firm but again it s a personal choice ,0
 The only little niggle was when we got back to the hotel at 10 45 we ordered drinks at the bar and then asked for food people around us were eating and the barman told us it was getting busy and to go over to the restaurant to eat We waited for our drinks and headed over to the restaurant which was closed We have a feeling that he was trying to avoid having to work later than possible which we do understand but thought a little cheeky It didn t spoil our stay though ,0
 Power cut for a few hours one morning Not notified Only told when we phoned and asked Therefore no hot water either so wasted half day waiting for a shower No free drink voucher or the like for the inconvenience Asked for extra pillows never arrived Apparently I d booked wrong check out date Saturday instead of Sunday even though on check in the receptionist informed me I could arrange late check out on Sunday if I needed it and so asked to book a further night Was told that they had no rooms and I had half an hour to get my bags Asked for her help but she was completely unhelpful bordering on rude and said well we have no rooms here No suggestions for other hotels in the area etc Would not use again or recommend ,0
 A note under everyonesdoor about the power outage and to say breakfast was still available would have been good Also no apologies given at reception on way out or by email after for the inconvenience,0
 Our room key stopped working and it was a long walk back to reception from our room to ask for help We also experienced a power cut which although not the hotels fault proved problematic when trying to use the bathroom early in the morning ,0
 The room was cold There was only one pillow per person with no extra pillows available ,0
 The food Breakfast is fine but the room service dinner I had was very disappointing and room services is never cheap Working away and long hours I didn t get to eat until about 8 30pm Receiving a burnt bottomed rock hard pizza with poor flavours is not what you need after a long travel day I couldn t finish it so for me it was a waste of money ,0
 Toilet could be prepered better For 3 people just one set 5ml of shower gel and shampoo Some pilows bit hard and not comfy ,0
 Access is not easy and was made even more difficult from the car park as the main lifts were out of order Also no food available after 2300 when many guests are returning from the theatre concerts clubs etc ,0
 Temperature in the whole hotel was too high room especially so even with thermostat set on minimum ,0
 The breakfast was a little expensive so we passed ,0
 I think the trump When u are going to underground Its either u are going to use stairs or trump If u have luggage u need to use the trump ,0
 Both pedestrian entrances to this hotel were potentially unsafe after dark being poorly lit and easy for attackers to strike Even as a couple we felt unsafe and we are used to London ,0
 Continental breakfast poor value for money and some items forgotten on both mornings A la carte restaurant very expensive and poor value for money Double bed was not very comfortable ,0
 Breakfast was warm not hot Our room was not serviced during our two nights stay hence no clean towels etc Keycards expired the first evening and we were missing from the breakfast list ,0
 check in on tablet took si much time porter service not available and noone there to pick up my luggage spent like 20 minutes going up and down with all my bags wifi is unsecured so my business laptop could not connect due to insufficient security Room could be furnished more practically ,0
 There are very less infact zero dine in options for Muslims We wanted to try fish and chips but even it was cooked in liquor So we ordered food from outside ,0
 I left behind a bottle of expensive perfume I d just received as a gift However when I contacted the hotel they said the housekeeping team hadn t handed it in ,0
 The check in system is complicated using iPads They get you to sit down with a staff member and it all takes quite some minutes which is annoying when you have pre booked with all the info and are tired from a long flight ,0
 The rooms were fine but the decor in our room was very bland could do with a splash of colour Bathroom a bit tired toilet was leaking from the base ,0
 Room was on the third floor and was close to some sort of loud speaker convention that was being held that weekend The staff could have informed us of the event ,0
 Bar staff could be a bit more friendly and aware of who to serve next Four lifts but not all working ,0
 The queue for breakfast was a little slow otherwise terrific ,0
 Cleaners started work very early and were very noisy outside the room and woke us We put the sign on the door saying do not disturb and the cleaner still came in ,0
 A little bit walk from metro 5 min But not so bad Staff not so cheerful ,0
 The car parking is a rip off and I was very disappointed with my meal at the Artisan restaurant I had a steak which was high on price but low on quality I ve had far better steaks for much less money I ate it because it was my partner s birthday and didn t want any hassle Otherwise I would ve most certainly made a complaint,0
 Being awoken by the local building works at 08 00am Appreciate this is not the hotel s fault but this still put a damper on an otherwise faultless stay ,0
 The hotel is weirdly arranged at ground level with two entrances both signposted Main Entrance and neither staffed at night reception is on the floor above This caused problems when I booked a taxi home and it went to the wrong entrance ,0
 Breakfast wasn t included in the price and our coffee machine didn t work ,0
 Cleaned our room at 3 30 pm just when we had come back for a rest after being out all day before going out to a show so we had to wait in reception for 15 minutes,0
 Thought booking com indicated breakfast included on prices before I booked but it wasn t I have stayed here before breakfast was good so this was a factor in booking here again We didn t have breakfast this time as would have been 4 x 17 50 extra ,0
 Bathroom was old and uncomfortable Loud construction outside of the hotel Most of the furniture was worn out Too expensive for whay they offer superior room ,0
 Founds stains on the towels Sleeper couch was poor Had arranged late checkout but the staff checked us out prematurely and we were unable to get back into our room Very rudely they said they had no record of our late checkout request I contacted Novotel directly and they promised to look after us at our next stay the following week Unfortunately they didn t fulfill this promse Price per night was poor value for money ,0
 The room charge of 20 for breakfast when waiting time was incurred in the dining room Also laundry charges very high for holiday guests with no other choice ,0
 Breakfast was very poor greasy bacon was hard all left under lights too long had to ask for milk bread fruit etc to be filled up both mornings not wot we expect from your hotels,0
 Had to wait to be seated a while No cups cutlery on table Think this is because it is just very busy,0
 A little awkward to find entrance from the Underground station though the road layout doesn t help ,0
 view was of the car park parking very very expensive the a la carte restaurant was very expensive for what it was ,0
 System at Reception If busy it can be quite a wait to get hold of staff That said once it is your turn staff couldn t be more helpful ,0
 Internal lock missing from the door into the room Although this was fixed when I pointed it out to the girl who cleans the room No water bottles and no shower caps anymore Only 2 pillows for 2 beds Apparently we the customer don t want or use these items so if you want them you have to ask house keeping ,0
 restaurant staff at breakfast herded us like cattle and even tried to take plates we were still eating from without a single word or eye contact Sadly we couldn t make use of free drink at the bar as there was a convention on and nowhere for us to sit Bed was uncomfortable ,0
 At check in I was asked if I had stayed at the hotel before The receptionist then went into a back room for a very long time and I was left standing at the desk When she returned I was asked if I had any outstanding balance to pay from my last visit which I did not I was made to feel very uncomfortable by the delay and felt as if I was being accused of something underhand ,0
 Petty annoyance was the mattress was too soft so I couldn t sleep well That s personal preference though as each to there own ,0
 Place could do with tidying up paint job there was plaster peeling off in places Very expensive for what you get Breakfast is great but service was lacking at times Had to ask for coffee 3 times before service and that wasn t on the busy day Had a conference on on one of the days but we hadn t been warned ended up queuing for breakfast not what we expected If they had said been warned we would have come down earlier or atleast wouldn t be mentioning it here Car parked 1 50 an hour We parked up at a tube station for our duration and paid 5 a day Unlikely to use again ,0
 Not a lot really Bedding looked a little worn in places but was perfectly clean Very minor ,0
 The room size the lighting is not enough in the room The bed is not that comfy I didn t like the attitude of one of the staffs who brought me a dental kit Its NOT value of money ,0
 An extra pillow and extra blanket per bed would have been perfect Could have asked but didn t want to bother anyone It s not a deal breaker ,0
 Very busy place bit of a wait for the lift at times The gym was hot smelly and poorly ventilated and the Wifi wasn t always overly reliable ,0
 On arrival no soap shampoo etc in room Quickly remedied after informing staff ,0
 Was on a group tour and we had no wifi was told we had wifi in the lobby but this was very limited Also the room keys kept locking us out twice I had to go down to have the keys reset ,0
 The price of breakfast plug on bath,0
 Slightly expensive with NO breakfast included Have stayed often and normally have breakfast included ,0
 Hotel took my bank card details on check in I thought as a guarantee pay the balance on checkout but then when I had left the hotel to head into London for the afternoon tried to take payment without me being present entering a PIN number My bank Santander blocked the request and 3 others from the hotel All different amounts with the first being nearly 200 more than the total amount for the weekend Santander then blocked the card Couldn t unblock until the following morning Praise to Santander not happy with the hotel and told them so Got apologies and 2 free drinks at the bar I would use the hotel again but just clarify on check in WHEN they want payment and don t hand over your card like I did ,0
 Despite having 4 lifts we seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time waiting for them ,0
 the bathroom could be more cleaner but it s really just a hotel chain with a lack of personality,0
 There weren t enough staff to handle check ins outs We d been waiting in the queue for 10 minutes and were next in line to be served A pilot walks up to the side of us and is served immediately We were told the pilot was late for the airport Sure ,0
 Room 3083 extremely noisy above wedding party when I had particularly requested quiet room Was offered another room at half past midnight not convenient to repack move and no reply to my complaint via email bad customer after service Put off booking again,0
 N a,0
 The room was uncomfortably hot and changing the aircon did not make any difference The shower is so uncomfortable and water was going everywhere You cannot properly stand in i The room is perfect for persons with special needs but for us it was really uncomfortable We stayed in room 8035 ,0
 The entrance to the hotel was not clearly marked and was difficult to find In addition there we not signs around the building that were easy to view from the street so travelers coming from the underground station would have difficultly identifying the building ,0
 If I m being really picky it would have been useful to have had some hooks in the bathroom to hang things up Also we only had one bathrobe and one pair of slippers for a double room but this was rectified once we notified reception ,0
 The fact that the hotel is in a concrete jungle Coming in the back as the front was closed was a bit scary at night The hotel is very big and the corridors are long and samey ,0
 A conference of some 700 delegates held in the hotel made it extremely difficult to access areas such as the bar or to even find a place to sit This resulted in seeking food and drink outside the hotel ,0
 Breakfast should be included as standard for the price of 170 pn wasn t going to pay an extra 17 for it when i can get a 3 sandwich around the corner ,0
 It s huge long corridors But it is a big hotel so there is not a lot you can do 0 ,0
 The staff replaced my towels every night which was nice but not really necessary ,0
 Hotel charges are abnormal and also the necessities are also being charged by the hotel such as plug for charger which i feel should be provided by the hotel,0
 There was no hotel information in the room usually there s a little book or folder Only a little thing if I had to put a negative ,0
 Dreadful awful directions really infuriating Impossible to work out where the residents car park is when you arrive just looks like a normal paying car park and it is NOT clear that it is for residents Once the car was unloaded we headed to the signs for Reception and the lift but the lift was not working and the sign saying use alternative stairs lift points to a wall It took ages to find stairs as there are no signs We found some stairs and then we had to walk up numerous flights with all our luggage Awful start to our stay Breakfast the staff that cleared away the tables need to be more courteous the lady who cleared the table as we were shown to our seat seemed very unhappy and did not want to be there Then when I had finished eating but my husband was still half way through a cooked breakfast a waiter came and cleared everything away apart from his plate and knife and fork teapot side plate cups and glasses everything He was still eating very rude I also don t want to see a manager stood there with her arms folded looking everyone up and down as they pass through very unprofessional and then give a member of staff a dressing down in front of everyone If you have an issue with a staff member take it out the back please When checking out there were no signs showing how to get to the car park wandered aimlessly for a good few minutes the reception bar area has signs for everything except the car park and we had no idea where we came in So frustrating in the end we had to ask Sign your hotel better Novotel I stay in hotels all over the world regularly and this was a poor show ,0
 Didn t receive any slippers bathrobes etc and wasn t informed of where to get them from but was told that that was what our room would include ,0
 The shower in our room could be bigger I found it a bit claustrophobic Lifts are slow The two lifts going to street level were out of order which was a bit of a nuisance The bar could stay open a little later at weekends with bar snacks available until close ,0
 It s not the easiest hotel to find your way in to and when we did find an entrance the lift was not working so we had to phone reception who told us how to find the main entrance of the hotel ,0
 No TV in public rooms ie no Wimbledon My cc was swiped at noon without me being present despite the fact that I told reception that I wasn t leaving till the afternoon I had checked out of my room And left my car in the garage and my suitcase with the porter,0
 Reception area There seemed to be no system as some staff were behind a desk and others seemed to approach guests to check in or help I was waiting for a while and was overlooked by two staff before I went to a free receptionist behind a desk ,0
 Unable to get an answer from the hotel telephone to revise my reservation and so forfeiting my payment but in particular with using booking com who did not help in resolving the issue which was in minutes of making the reservation through booking com who reserved two rooms under different conditions as advertised Maybe a very small part of this was my error but still not acceptable ,0
 Car parking too expensive My room was 147 and my car parking was 98 very dis satisfied with this and will not stay again due to car park price which is a shame ,0
 A little off the main street ,0
 I asked to only pre authorize my credit card as I was going to pay whole accommodation and extras on cash They said ok but they finally charged my card as they said by mistake I requested to have my shirts ironned but they told me that they do not offer this facility and that I should do it by myself as I had an iron and ironboard in my room despite the fact that inside the room they had a laundry list including a price for ironing shirts For a 4 hotel they had no bathrobes slippers bathroom amenities only shampoo shower gel and soap felt that I should use them very carefully as they would have not replace them if run out in the room Food is average 4 00 sterling for Room Service charge Are they serious Better say I don t want to offer this service do not order Reception staff did not give any information upon check in E g available restaurants breakfast hours e t c I even had to ask for directions to my room ,0
 Service rooms are run down our room basin was not draining was not fixed till next day Breakfast was a very poor quality the servers were very rood I have lot to say but terrible experience that s all I want to say ,0
 The fact that we had to pay 1 50 per hour for parking after paying 150 per NIGHT to stay in the hotel was shocking and also our power went off whilst we were getting ready in the morning and the staff didn t seem bothered Lastly a 50 charge was added to the bill incase we used room service which we wasn t told about luckily we didn t have to pay this at the end ,0
 The parking fees are extortionate The staff at the hotel forgot to validate our ticket and when brought to his and the managers attention it took an hour to sort and we didn t even get an apology ,0
 restaurants on premises too expensive could not get in and out of shower easily could not figure out how to turn on shower,0
 There were very few power sockets in the room The drinks in the fridge and bar were very expensive ,0
 The sound of the ice machine just outside our room would benefit from a quieter running motor However when we mentioned this to the staff on our arrival we were offered a change of room We declined because this room had views over the central London skyline ,0
 Location Atmosphere No real gym for the size of the hotel No sauna at all,0
 The lift was out of order a cleaner tried to enter the room at 9 30am and parking was too expensive 39 for overnight and that was with a discount ,0
 Scruffy run down approach to hotel Room was very Spartan in decoration definitely no frills Air conditioning is just a fan totally ineffective and couldn t open windows due to traffic noise so room was extremely hot and stuffy Spot of fresh blood on one of our pillows Just one small bottle of water in room Barely adequate toiletries in bathroom 17 50 for breakfast is outrageous Overall impression is penny pinching meanness,0
 1 The Ice maker wasn t working on our floor 2 There wasn t an ice bucket 3 The mini fridge didn t work 4 The outlet by TV didn t work so we only had one working outlet 5 There wasn t any wash cloths to wash our faces so we used the hand towels 6 The extra lock to prevent someone getting in located on top half of the door was broken See picture,0
 The hair found inside the sausage at breakfast and some of the hot food trays were empty The car park pricing way too much for an overnight stay ,0
 Queue very long and slow for breakfast Bed pillows not the best Bluetooth speaker in room didn t work One of the plug sockets in room didn t work,0
 I got called ma am when I m a Sir there were cracks in the paintwork and tiles in the bathroom and the shower went from luke warm to scolding hot by it s own volition ,0
 Breakfast was excellent but pricey compared to cost of stay and bar prices No pool ,0
 When we walked into the hotel there was no reception desk it was up another floor and no one helped us to find the reception floor even though staff were around It was a rather business hotel which did make us feel slightly uncomfortable as the staff didn t help us as much as we weren t clients or there for meetings Everyone should be treated individually it wasn t only us staying there who felt this way The Breakfast was also at a ridiculous price ,0
 Value for money not great Breakfast is way too expensive at 17 50 for a cooked English breakfast and not very nice If you want it delivered to your room they tell you it s only a four pound supplement on top of a continental breakfast but then say there is a 10 poind tray charge which is a ridiculous claim to make why not just admot you re charging 27 50 to bring a cooked breakfast to the room Bath was tiny too Overall though we were satified with the hotel ,0
 I stayed with my cousin in a twin room and once again we found the heating was far too stifling even when turned down the system isn t easy to control ,0
 Signage to the reception area from outside was not very clear my taxi driver had to go around the car park area to distinguish the conference entrance to the hotel entrance as from the outside it is not clear that reception is on the first floor Buffet dinner was nice but the desserts were disappointing they tasted like defrosted cakes ,0
 the price of car park this shouldn t be an extra cost Showers very dangerous as the temperature fluctuates regularly which left me with a burn on my shoulder The temperature goes scolding hot then cold Could be very dangerous if a baby infant was using ,0
 Tv didn t work but we didn t stay in the room to use it as we travelled down for a gig ,0
 Booked an executive room Air conditioning did not work shower had a mind of its own and decided to cycle the temperature between ice cold and burning hot no matter what setting The carpet in the room was very dirty hairs everywhere ,0
 Stained carpet in room 8069 All in all carpets in rooms and corridors could do with an up grade Very dingy No shower caps in bathrooms en suite ,0
 unmanned reception ie not enough staff for the number of people checking in nobody made an executive decision to call for help I therefore stopped a walking by member of staff and asked them to help at reception which reduced the queue by half ,0
 My wife not liking lifts and we were on the top floor However once the receptionist learnt of this they immediately offered to move us,0
 The only thing I don t like is the view but it s not that important ,0
 Access to reception is poor Access either via a dark undercroft and take a lift to the first floor reception or via external poorly maintained stairs and a dated upper paved area But once inside it s fine ,0
 No bin liners in bins must have been forgotten no big deal Wifi speed was slow but connecting was simple ,0
 Room service should really have been collected Leftover food was left in room overnight If the tray needs to be put outside of the door for collection then perhaps this needs to be made clear ,0
 The bed was too hard and the shower head wouldn t stay upright Breakfast although very nice was expensive ,0
 No bad things to say at all would highly recommend,0
 Overall a comfortable stay Only thing was the carpeted room smelled a bit old ,0
 Bed was huge but was a bit on the firm side,0
 I was not very impressed with the breakfast food but variety was ok For a 4 star hotel food could be better quality and tastier ,0
 Cleaners in the morning kept knocking on my door a few just let themselves in while was present,0
 It is a bit far from everything really big building with no pleasant atmosphere rather small rooms with very basic equipment The bathroom was small the toilet did not work properly and staff was not very helpful I came here because it was close to my meeting point ,0
 Location was good for the event at the Apollo however a little way out of central London ,0
 The parking was a little pricey for a weekend stay it was a flat 1 50 per hour so an overnight stay when you checked in a little early was nearly 40 00 they should look to have a 20 night cap for residents or something similar just a thought ,0
 The bed was a bit hard for me maybe that s a personal choice but I like beds a little softer Bedding all very nice though and otherwise everything was very comfortable ,0
 Oh my days the beds are so hard They make a big thing about how fantastic there new beds are but boy don t think anyone who made the decision to purchase them have ever tried sleeping in them ,0
 The restaurants are not structured The bar manager didn t really have a clue I would definitely recommend sorting the staff and menu out as the food was delicious it just weren t put on menu as it should be ,0
 The bar menu not explaining what is in a meal and the staff not saying either resulting in an over ordering of food ,0
 Poor room insulation and hotel was very busy with large groups of noisy neighbours Rooms on hot side and ac very noisy ,0
 It was really really warm at night even with the windows open as much as they could go It made for restless sleep ,0
 We didn t pay for food as 17 50 per person per night for breakfast is a ridiculous amount to pay ,0
 Smoking rooms would have been desirable as it was a long trip to go up and down to smoke ,0
 Coffee cups were dirty drip marks still on them after room had been cleaned ,0
 Bed was not comfortable and room carpet was very stained and needed replacing not just cleaned We were told that tv had pay per view channels but not the case Ordered a lamb curry from room service and a veggie curry was delivered This was taken off our bill but only after complaining twice ,0
 I didn t like how loud it was at night I didn t know whether to complain to reception as our neighbour was talking loudly until 2am in the morning ,0
 Room service was appalling Dirty dishes from evening meal left in corridor until after 4pm the following day Food mediocre Delivered to room uncovered Tried to call room service to complain about wrong order but rang and rang no answer Rooms dismal Staff sparse Not a relaxing stay at all Given a small double at first when I clearly showed my pre paid reservation for a superior with sofa bed complained and moved to the correct room type Don t know what their 4 star rating is based on Housekeeping made up beds left clean towels but dirty glasses were left in room Heat in room unbearable during the night despite air con ,0
 Only 1 robe and slippers when the room was for 2 adults Temperature in the room was far too hot ,0
 We waited over an hour to be served at the bar due to a massive queue and there only being two people on Several people complained at reception but they didn t do anything about it Also breakfast is ridiculously expensive at 17 50 per person,0
 I found the bath a little too narrow at the one end ,0
 Walking back to the hotel The entrances were a bit dark on the same floor as reception some lights were not working bushes need cutting back and it felt a bit unsafe walking back from the tube in Hammersmith ,0
 Parking is extortionate to be charged at an hourly rate even when staying overnight which in my opinion is wrong when you are paying 100 pounds per night to stay staff were obviously not too sympathetic and said as it was a weekend we could park out on the street for free this was not my preference at all had to park a few streets away which was a bit of a walk in very cold weather I think a flat rate should be charged to park overnight Carpet in our room was covered in stains of all shapes and sizes apart from that it was clean enough,0
 Looked sketchy from the outside so was anxious on arrival but as soon as walked in to reception my concerns disappeared Would definitely stay again ,0
 Having stayed here a couple times was disappointed with our 1st room door hanging of toilet and carpet filthy went to reception and they moved us overall just needs a bit of a face lift ,0
 The view from the room was awful And the coffee in the breakfast room was pretty weak Also the prices were very high 5 for a sandwich ,0
 For the money the rooms were poor quality Very old and out dated Very worn out Staff and cleanliness were top notch but lack of investment in the rooms really let it down You can get a lot better for a lot less,0
 Arrangements for breakfast We had to miss the breakfast that we had payed for because the queue was horrendous We didn t even arrive downstairs late Breakfast facilities need an overhaul ,0
 Bar staff too busy spinning and dropping bottles and glasses rather than just dealing with the queue ,0
 There were only 4 plug sockets in the room 2 by the desk 1 by the mirror and 1 next to the bed which was broken annoying ,0
 Very poor slow wifi Extremely expensive breakfast about 18 each Don t know how good it was we just bought a bacon butty from a shop,0
 room d cor a bit dated ,0
 the carpets in our room were disgusting with stains all over they need changing or at least cleaning had to keep shoes on,0
 The room was a bit warm and we couldn t work the air con ,0
 Found the staff frosty at times and constantly talking between themselves one other guest commented he had been interrupted three times ordering from the bar Check in was reasonably quick but having an I pad check in to speed things up looks a little daft when you have to be taken to 4 chip and pins devices to find one that works Bathroom was very clean but not great when the door doesn t really close the bath shower was a bit disappointing ,0
 The one and only fault was that we had a power failure in our room in the morning which was a slight inconvenience but it was resolved quickly and efficiently ,0
 Coffee at b fast shower was a little temperamental ,0
 we both found the bed and pillows not very comfortable Mind you that could be that we are used to a Tempur mattress and pillows Expensive for just a room and no breakfast ,0
 Was disappointed that there was a charge for the car park as we were staying at the hotel didn t expect to pay It was not clear on the site I booked on I chose the hotel as my husband is disabled and can not walk far ,0
 Not enough tea and coffee in the room shower went hot and cold ,0
 The room was freezing Couldn t take a shower because the bathroom was too cold I had to put my coat and cloths over the bed as there was no spare blanket The heater was useless I could not be bothered to call anyone at the time because it was gone 11 30pm when we went to our room It s the only thing that spoilt an otherwise good hotel ,0
 The room was a little dated and for a 4 star hotel the cleanliness of our room should have been considerably better Whilst the car park was very convenient the concessionary charge for guests of 1 50 hour for the car park seemed excessive it cost us 27 for an overnight stay ,0
 n a,0
 Only one teabag each in the room When I asked for another teabag they gave me some but could not supply any milk Very odd Also when ordering drinks at the bar we were waiting for 30 minutes as there was only one person behind the bar two others just walking about and he was pratting around making a cocktail while flicking left and right ,0
 The rude resident who was not very pleasant to one of your waitresses in the bar area ,0
 Room had been smoked in although it was a non smoking room in fact there was still a packet of Marlboro sitting on the table when we went in Each time you go into a hotel room you should feel like you are the first to use it this spoiled that illusion considerably Guys at the bar after the show were being really fancy with their cocktails which was quite entertaining for a few minutes then I just wanted my pint of beer and G T and its took forever to get to the front of the queue especially after a busy show at the Apollo Maybe you could have separate cocktail queues somehow ,0
 The cleanses of the room was almost nill The bath badly designed there is no place to put your soap champion etc ,0
 That for 135 a night it didn t include breakfast Also the cost of parking in the hotel car park ,0
 Our room was a little noisy with people walking past the room and there was somesort of banging noise but not a problem for a 1 night stay ,0
 front desk seemed a bit confused with payment card pre authourised but took payment at leaving full payment outstanding for another 4 days and showed on my a c as a debit even though paid in full Sorted but no need for this hassle View of a hotel roof ,0
 Withdrawal of money from visa debit card for a deposit of 50 which l was informed the morning after will not be back in my account until the next week I m extremely angry about this not being explained ,0
 lots of space but very little seating in bar restaurant we wished to eat here but were unable to do so ,0
 In the restaraunt where we were sitting when my partner stood up the light was too low and he bumped his head on it ,0
 Outside lighting deplorable Dangerous even Lift from car park not working sign AT the lift with no directions to another Car park very expensive Bar staff slow and spoke together in a foreign language Seemed very rude Hardly any tea or coffee and a tiny biscuit each in our room I paid to have a bath and then couldn t use it as plug inefficient even when i stood on it and yes i do know how to use that type of plug Wifi should not need time consuming e mail details Awful view from window ,0
 Approach to the hotel was dowdy and litter strewn with patches of not recent vomit on the steps The surfaces were uneven and had many insecure bricks or holes whet paving was missing We did not feel particularly safe when approaching it in the dark ,0
 Staff s grasp of English on reception was poor Had to wait a long time for breakfast whilst staff milled about not clearing loads of vacant tables,0
 Artisan restaurant was slow service and bland food Rooms were like saunas We had an executive room so god knows how bad the standard rooms were Paid for breakfast but service was that slow on the buffet breakfast that the queue was out the restaurant and passed reception I paid 130 to stay here and quickly wanted to check out cause I was disgusted and then got hit with a 27 car park bill and that s with hotel occupants discount Won t be staying here again ,0
 Only minor issue was that the TV wasn t working on the machines in the gym but all was not lost I had my iPod ,0
 restaurant and bar couldn t cope with busy times and queues were long Best breakfast in Hammersmith which is 3 mins walk away The adjoining rooms meant we could hear neighbours talking in next room ,0
 We thought the price of 19 50 each was excessive for a breakfast when you can get a full breakfast down the road for 6 each Didn t try it so maybe its the best breakfast you ll ever have it should be for that price anyway ,0
 Huge queues at the restaurant and bar Both things obviously not big enough for the size of the hotel Must be a recurring problem because they advertise that there will be delays,0
 Seemed unready for the post show rush in the bar Breakfast was plentiful some it of questionable quality Pancakes for example were old and hard Very Limited room service menu choice after 11pm Also very poor quality ,0
 The complete palava at trying to get a drink from the bar at getting in late As a resident I am used to being able to get a drink at the bar if it is open Having to bring staff in from another area to come and pour a drink was a joke But the joke was on me being charged 25 for two gin and tonics London or not a complete rip off ,0
 It was freezing in our room Bed felt damp it was so cold Heating on to 30 degrees and still cold Couldn t shower bathroom too cold Heating only worked with blower which was too loud Slept in clothes with coats on the bed as no extra blankets in the room ,0
 Staff were not very accommodating to rectify a mistake I had made with the booking One room did not have slippers and robes and the coffee machine did not work I have emailed a complaint about this but did not even receive the courtesy of a reply,0
 No bad experience all smiles ,0
 Noise Banging Doors Either Side friends in out of rooms either side late in eve I was too cold Couldn t warm room up Bit grotty in shower bath needs re grouting Hairs in bath etc ,0
 Alcoholic drinks a little expensive More information in the room and on website about the two hotel restaurants would be good ,0
 Only complaint was the bed was a little hard and uncomfortable ,0
 We got upgraded but got given the standard room key and didn t have time to say anything before we went out they asked us if wr would like to move to the upgraded room when we got back at 12am And our standard room key wouldn t work ,0
 The food tasted fine but I did end up feeling poorly It was very noisy I don t think there is any sound proofing at all as we could hear a family next door singing happy birthday in the early hours of the morning The room felt a little dated ,0
 Only negative is that customers are expected to queue in single file at the bar or you don t get served Experienced staff would not have needed this sort of queue to determine who to serve in turn whether in a queue or stood at the bar ,0
 Due to type of coffee machine in room it failed common fault with that brand the type of drop plug in the bath was damaged as shower was above it and people stand on it damaging the mechanism again a common fault but not unique ,0
 If i had to be picky one barman left us standing at the bar whilst he was making drinks only to eventually ask us to take a seat and wait for table service we didn t mind but we wish that he had told us straight away so then we weren t stood there waiting ,0
 Food The lounge food was not very appetizing The Aroma restaurant was closed most of the time The buffet was very expensive ,0
 Queuing up trying to check in and out was very slow and bad took some time you may have been short staffed at that time It was very hot in the room too water pressure wasn t the best ,0
 AC wasn t working in my room When the repair man came to fix it he couldn t and then told me that it s winter and people don t need the AC Room was uncomfortably hot Check out was a nightmare My cab driver was waiting to take me to the airport Twice reception told me I had money to be owed however this was untrue after they checked their records I had the same problem at check in Bell boy took over 20 min to bring my bags down from my room Wouldn t reccomend this hotel ,0
 My room was on a floor where there were repairs being carried out The corridor was in such a mess that I would ve preferred to have had a room on another floor ,0
 Sink and bath didn t drain properly and the shower guard on the bath wasn t fitted correctly so the bathroom floor flooded when you took a shower Air conditioning didn t work room was really hot but the streets were too noisy to have the window open at night ,0
 Faulty bathroom door that staff had no urgency to fix What seemed like v un organised staff working on checkin desks as queues were v long upon arrival and check out Asked for a bathmat sat AM never turned up and we checked out sun so another delay When I made the booking it was for a special occasion for my wife our her best friends 40th I asked for a bunch of flowers upon arrival or balloons etc to make it more memorable and i didnt mind paying for the extras upon arrival unfortunately this never happened If I would of been advised that this is something you would not do I could of arranged something myself and got there earlier to arrange ,0
 The only thing was no soap in the bathroom ,0
 Grill staff who were slow and didn t understand basic English ,0
 Breakfast was 17 50 which I thought was a bit steep Room was a bit small for a superior room Only thing that made it any different to a normal room was a mini fridge with 4 bottles of water in it ,0
 The hotel lobby and bar restaurant area were extremely hot It would be more comfortable in a cooler atmosphere We have used this hotel twice now and both times need to queue a fair time to book in at reception ,0
 IN ONE OF THE ROOMS THERE WAS A SMELL OF SICK COMING FROM THE DRAIN IN THE BATHROOM VERY UNPLEASENT ,0
 Way too warm thermostat useless Took ages to check in despite repeatedly telling the girl that we had my Brother s Wedding in 45 mins and were running late ,0
 I ordered a taxi for the morning but the guy in the reception forgot to book the driver Was waiting for more than 30 minutes,0
 We travelled with three teenage children and three adults on a special trip to Olympia all booked separately via booking com My friend booked on the same day as us and got a much better deal including breakfast 105 00 we had to pay 120 per night We were staying two nights and the hotel wanted to charge 17 00 each for breakfast which for a buffet style meal and in particular for a child is ridiculous We were not in a position to pay this amount of money and were left with our children being split from their friends at breakfast time I did mention it to the reception and they offered us a coffee as compensation which falls far short of what I think they should offer Why are Novotel offering such extreme rate differences We used the restaurant on a separate occasion the previous night we opted for the restaurant and quite honestly the food was appalling ,0
 Room very warm couldn t open windows very much Air con did not cool room ,0
 Staff were rude and not very informative Had to ask where and when breakfast was Booked as supposed to be 4 star Room basic and carpet all marked and stained Only 2 teabags in room Advised taxi to olympia when could have walked and would have been quicker ,0
 Had a bit of trouble with our room and rather than come up to our room with the solution they made me go to reception even though I told them I had walking difficulties ,0
 Difficult to find reception and would have preferred a larger fridge,0
 The breakfast tea was not very hot asked for a second pot which was just as bad some of the items like bacon were cooked to a crisp ,0
 Didn t like the pillows Strange shape that did not provide a comfortable position for the neck ,0
 Not really a dislike but the breakfast was fairly ordinary and not particularly good value for money ,0
 Service in bar terrible Waited 10mins in queue asked to sit at table for table service waited another 20mins Gave up ,0
 We thought the carpets were dull grubby looking in the corridors rooms ,0
 the young foreign receptionist was hard work and couldn t understand how I had booked 2 rooms each for two adults in my name but our friends would occupy the second room but didn t share our surname ,0
 Not enough instant coffee in the room only for two cups per day Would be nice to have a cup in the morning and a cup in the afternoon No soap dish The sink is very nice but there is no place to put the soap,0
 Most things Once you passed the lobby it was a different hotel Tired dark hallways with cracked broken ceiling tiles preceded a room which was sad and dark Shower knobs were missing pieces light switches covered in grime a window that looked directly into another guest room window hot sticky air pumped into the room and overall cheap furniture and finishings It s not an expensive hotel but you can get so much more for your money elsewhere ,0
 Laud fan in the room because of blowing wind outside thin walls so you could hear doors open ect And we even had a big stain on the sheet But Im sure it had been washed so I didnt complane But for 149 pounds ,0
 Bedrooms are small and not compfy Even after complaining and being moved to another room it was no better Very shabby,0
 Stingy with basic necessities No bath mat provided Cheap toilet roll Extremely small amount of shower gel ,0
 the poor choice of foods on the bar menu the state of repair of the toilets on the 2nd floor the stingy towels and toiletries in the bedrooms ,0
 Horrible room service We had to wait over an hour for food and when it finally arrived my burger was burned and my husband s noodles cold ,0
 wifi extremely weak no video on skype possible rooms are rather old too bad for such a known hotel network executive room has a view at least whereas twin rooms overview the roof safe was broken no reparation done within 6 days stay water the sink is not going away wouldn t like to stay there again,0
 two nites of torture no A C only blows hot air we complained and was promised by Micha to have room with working A C but after long day was given worse room blowing hot air we were put up in nicer room 9th floor but no A C had to open window to noise light then either to hot or cold I m sick now from lack of sleep Thanks Novotel never stay with you again,0
 I usually stay at the Novotel Blackfriars which shames this hotel Rooms are dated and standards are more like an Ibis than a Novotel personally I ve stayed in better Premier Inns ,0
 The room was really small and the Worst was the heating in That bedroom completly awfull more than 30 all night even if you were putting the thermostat at 0,0
 Not enough shower gel shampoo Slightly pricy but expected in London ,0
 Carpet badly stained shower running hot and cold not constant temperature pillows quite weird always only one dressing gown in cupboard when couple are using the room Public area near lifts certainly on 4th floor need a lick of paint,0
 the bath shower looked a bit tired and the room was very warm We couldn t get the room cooler without opening the window which then made it quite loud due to general London traffic ,0
 Entrance not on the main road Road to main entrance is poorly lit ,0
 I was woken up by workmen drilling new locks into doors along my corridor first thing in the am Huge hotel v run of the mill rooms Better value for money at a premier inn The breakfast was pretty poor for 17 50 ,0
 Air con in room didnt work so room was too warm in november Car park was offered at over 50 discount which sounded good until we were billed at 35 per day That is normal for centralish london but they tried to convince me they charge 87 for non residents so we had got a cracking deal Hmm,0
 As we were walking from Fulham it was difficult to locate and poor signage We had to walk through the bus park and shopping centre to find the entrance ,0
 Cleaner didn t knock on the door before entering at 11 15am when check out is mid day no apology received when reported to check out staff ,0
 Lift from car park to reception area is woefully small and slow Car park charges for hotel residents are very high Room could do with a refresh carpet dirty walls need repainting ,0
 Didn t like that had to pay for car park thought it should be included ,0
 No bad experience as such but the room 8060 where I stayed at the end of my trip there appeared to be some sort of fizzing noise coming from one of the sockets close to the bed Forgot to mention it in my hurry to catch a train,0
 Long wait to register only 2 staff on general desks Very busy reception area Need a quick access desk for pre booked guests,0
 Not really a bad experience but did feel the Artisan Grill was somewhat overpriced although the food was very nice Waited ages to be served at the bar in the evening ,0
 Carpet was absolutely filthy dirty and badly stained did not want to take my shoes off Shower broke complained x3 never was fixed smell of sewage when using bathroom tap disgusting ,0
 Registration on arrival was a shambles no order nobody knew where the queue was we complained and were taken to a desk ahead of other confused people We had pre paid and this was not a good start to our stay ,0
 Heard a lot of sirens I am aware that this can t be controlled by the hotel staff but it was the only thing that ruined the stay slightly by being woken up early Also it would be useful to have more plug sockets ,0
 Very odd experience had to ask housekeeping for more tea bags only 2 in room was immediately quizzed as to what time I was checking out Explained check out was 12pm so would be gone before then but was pushed to give an exact time to the lady Whilst I totally appreciate she has a job to do please let me enjoy my stay first ,0
 I didn t like the cost of the carpark even at the reduced rate I appreciate this is standard for London but even so ,0
 The let down of the hotel was the lack of staff at reception the whole of the weekend we were there there were only two desks manned and there was constantly a queue of guests waiting ,0
 Booking in out was a little slow but seemed to be rectified when queues developed ,0
 Hotel was too hot it made it slightly uncomfortable to sleep ,0
 We checked in dog tired after 4pm hoping to go straight into our room But the room was just about to be cleaned We lugged our cases down to the lobby and did not enter our room till around 5pm ,0
 Carpet stained with blood drops flagged to reception but obviously ignored by housekeeping Reception immediately offered another room Despite Booking com stating 1 room safe 2 pay per view channels neither were available ,0
 The room Old smelly no fresh air dark no hand soap AC didnt work so room constantly warm Not a very enjoyable stay The rest of the hotel was modern and clean but unfortunately I had to sleep in the horrible room ,0
 terrible beds really bad back ache never had in a hotel before insane prices in restaurant which why restaurant empty all the time totally stupid unacceptable waste of prime space even staff agree it is ludicrous charge for car park come on,0
 The parking It is ridiculous It says parking avaliable chargers may apply Definately aplly and at 1 50 an hour Absolute joke I paid 129 to basically sleep there and paid 27 for parking If I knew this I wouldn t have booked it and find this very dishonest ,0
 The bar staff Absolutely terrible the male staff member shouted at us on two separate occasions as well as other customers He should not be working there The young girl turned the TV off when we were watching it in the bar and refused to put it back on lifting tables over ours and people s heads We had no choice but to leave 10pm ,0
 Rooms were basically furnished and tired looking Bed linen had holes in it Free WiFi was intermittent and often ineffective,0
 had requested a high level floor but got room on level 3 first level for rooms typical basic hotel room although paid for a superior room had asked at reception for a good room but the view from the room was a flat roof between buildings at 2 30pm on Saturday in fairly empty lounge ordered a BLT took nearly 5 hour to arrive cold waitress without apology said the kitchen had been busy but no one was ordering food except us the hotel has 2 restaurants one buffet but closed on Saturday night limited cosmetics in bathroom no conditioner or shower cap only one night but had we stayed longer would have requested to be moved to a better located room ,0
 Breakfast frozen bread and cold food told one member of staff and they only said they would let someone know Saturday night was in bar for drinks lady bar manager was not very nice to other guest told them to go to bed or leave if they were not staying in hotel no way to treat guest,0
 the staff at breakfast picking up plates and other things from the table before we had finished eating the bar was worse very uncomfortable staff walking around all the time asking could they get us another drink when we hadnt finished the 1 we had we didnt get a chance to relax carpet in bar was in nead of hovering tv in room didnt work had to wait for ages to get through to reception girl overcharged for food had a big problem geting it sorted,0
 Being interruppted by staff 5 times from 08 00am when we weren t checking out until 12 noon Room too hot engineer called still hot next morning Although payment cleared on departure pre authorisation payment took 5 days to be removed from my account leaving me without any funds for the week disgusting and unprofessional I would expect a full refund to be honest So disappointed on what was suppose to be a special occassion for me ,0
 Asked for extra milk and coffee for our room did t get it Why water in the drinks fridge Not needed,0
 Nothin,0
 It s a disgrace that you charge 155 for an overnight stay and that you have to pay 1 50 per hour to hotel guests for parking 43 50 to park for a night stay Absolutely disgraceful And not even a breakfast for the price I won t be using Novotel again ,0
 I didn t like the fact you had to pay for parking it added an extra 33 on to our bill which was 155 already for one night with no breakfast I think if you are paying for a room in the hotel the parking should be free or a standard rate of 15 20 per night The breakfast was 17 50 per person which I though lt was really expensive so we went to Weatherspoons which was only a 5 minute walk and was really nice ,0
 Not a bad experience but we had an awful job working out how to get from the tube station to the hotel because the bus station and barriers were in the way It was very confusing We also thought breakfast was too expensive ,0
 The room was minimal vsv aesthetics compared with many similarly starred and priced hotels in the USA and Europe Breakfast was absurdly expensive I ate out or brought food from outside Difficult to locate at first ,0
 The cost of parking 30 to park from 14 00 on a Friday until 07 30 on the Saturday has to be factored into the cost of this hotel if visiting London with a car,0
 The price of the parking Very expensive they should just park a smaller set amount per 24 hours Disappointing especially when it is free to park outside on a sunday ,0
 Safe and bath plug did not work Parking very expensive 1 50 hr but it is London ,0
 Attitude of some of the staff particularly in the bar and when we went for breakfast They were very rude Also breakfast does not finish until 10 30 By 9 30 there was hardly any bread no ham and by 9 45 no croissants Quite poor if you want continental breakfast ,0
 The restaurant was very pricey and only decent quality food The beds were not super comfortable but average Power outage occurred during our stay which was inconvenient and somewhat scary Overall the hotel was expensive ,0
 Toilet seat on floor hairs in bath and a sink which didn t drain I ordered tea with my breakfast and despite chasing it didn t arrive Hopeless ,0
 Executive rooms 9th Floor don t have a bath Their website made it look like all rooms did have one and when being at the end of a hall there s no wifi connection possible Mind that during my first two stays here I did have a perfect wifi connection ,0
 Signage to car park not brilliant Background music in reception was very annoying Tea and coffee facilities in bedroom were a bit mean ,0

 The rooms are outdated with old furniture and bathroom ,0
 The air condion is not working in cool mode you have to open the window to get cool air The room i got is not as per the reservation,0
 Not hot water first night Then no power to wall sockets next day Inconsistency,0

 room is too small,0
 The evening service in Brummus the hotel restaurant was lacklustre compared to the excellent service at breakfast the following morning ,0
 I can t think of anything ,0
 The pool was too cold even for the children and they said they could not turn it up which is such a shame and explains why it is not used The staff in restaurant were abrasive and slow with poor English,0
 Check in information we were not provided information of serving times for breakfast where it was served or check out time A very minor issue ,0
 on tv no german news programs swimming pool not enough heated and around the pool no possibility to lay after swimming on a deck chair or a lie there are only normal chairs and 2 sofas before the bar on breakfast grilled toast often black burnt but for all that not more hot,0
 I could have stayed longer ,0
 I thought the breakfast could have done with some work We had room service and that was fine the timing was excellent but there could have been a little more attention to detail ,0
 It would have been nice to include tea coffee making facilities in the room and a pen or two along with the letter writing things rather than a pencil When we stayed in the Covent Garden Hotel we were all given a free scented candle A few more treats and trimmings for the price of the room would have been nice though we had a really good stay ,0
 Having to leave and not being able to stay longer,0
 Not all staff on front desk were attentive Lady was really nice younger man told us to take a seat whilst he checked our room was ready and then forgot about us,0
 Because the room was so lovely and offered a comfy sitting area it would have been a plus to have had tea coffee making facilities This is not a complaint however ,0
 Bed pillows not firm enough for me ,0
 The lounge area in bedroom could have been a little larger,0
 The only criticism of the hotels is that you are unable to make a cup of coffee or tea and must always use room service It isn t a problem for a one night stay but for longer it becomes a nuisance and also expensive ,0
 I did mention this to the management on my departure regarding the unacceptable noise that emanated from the room above From about 5 pm onwards to well after 10 30 it sounded as if a group of acrobates were practicing their act Running and jumping One evening I rang up reception to the unacceptable noise from the above floor They had no explanation of the of what was happening It occurred every evening that I stayed at the hotel ,0
 Smell of drains in the bathroom when emptying the bath only one roll of toilet paper which meant we used tissues until the room was serviced then they gave us two Only tiny things though didn t really matter ,0
 us not stopping long enough ,0
 It would be nice if the hotel could put up a more noticeable sign that we could see from the main road It wasn t fun for an 83 year old lady to have to walk back and forth just to find the entrance Also personally if the swimming pool isn t so functional please don t advertise about it To me it was like you re cheating the customers To have a proper pool you need to have a proper changing room with a shower for both sexes Guests should not be expected to change in the toilet ,0
 had to leave soon,0
 That we couldn t stay longer ,0
 Drinks were slow in arriving at dinner because the bar was very busy Wine arrived after we had finished our main course So 3 4 of a bottle was left behind ,0
 Checkout wasn t good I found the lady that dealt with me was discourteous and abrupt Also the location wasn t as ideal for us as I thought it would be ,0
 Lack of tea coffee making facilities also the bath took an incredibly long time to fill,0
 Only downside of an otherwise perfect stay was a slightly snooty member of staff in the bar but that was it and it didn t spoil the stay ,0
 It would have been nice if tea and coffee making facilities had been provided We were brought cups and saucers and fresh milk and were offered a kettle we had brought our own but it would have been better to have had these already in the room with sachets of coffee and tea bags We were confused by the organisation at breakfast It seems we should have waited for our order for cooked dishes to be taken before we served ourselves from the buffet but this was not explained to us when we were shown to our table ,0
 Flexible reading lights in the room would have been an improvement The pricing structure for breakfast is rather complicated ,0
 Did not like the fact that when we arrived on Friday and checked out on the Monday morning at 11 30am that we could not use the lovely swimming pool area we purposely booked this hotel because it had a swimming pool there was a private function on there on Saturday Sunday very disappointing,0
 No Coffee Making Facilities in the room becoming increasingly common in hotels these days ,0
 Renovation works being carried out in the room above very noisy had to ring and complain as it sounded like they were about to knock through into our room They stopped the work this was the afternoon we checked in However the next morning we could hear people going in and out of the room from 5 30am No in room tea or coffee facilities which is a shame as we didn t want to have to call down just for a cup of tea ,0
 Upon arrival we were told the pool gym spa area were closed for a private party Not good enough at all You advertised a significant feature which you then failed to let us have benefit from ,0
 The light levels in the room were not really adequate for reading a book the newspaper in the evening We find this is a problem common to most hotels what is required is a standard lamp behind the settee easy chairs However it is rare to find a room with one the assumption seems to be that guests look at a computer or watch the TV rather than read ,0
 No bad experiences,0
 we were not told in advance to going out for the evening that the bars were closed that evening for a private party so we went out for dinner and when we came back to have a drink in the bar we were told we could only go back to our room for a drink which was very disappointing if we had been warned of this we could of planned to stay out later ,0
 Pool was to die for but changing room not well signed and temperature of water was cool cold perhaps bracing best adjective ,0
 Our shower had clogged drain of water so I think the room shouldn t be sold Bed mattress was a little hard,0
 Swimming pool should be heated instead of air conditioned Spa gym area would have been nicer with sauna,0
 The price but you pay for what you get and it was worth every penny,0
 Just small notice regarding the in room dining to increase the menu options,0
 No tea and coffee in room,0
 Bed was too high staff attitude very condescending,0
 The way the glass light shook with the elephants that didn t much sleep in the room above ,0

 Waking us up replacing the carpet outside our bedroom door and cleaners removing medication from our room,0
 The swimming pool is freezing ,0
 Wines in minibar VERY expensive,0
 Room 200 had a view of a brick wall which is unacceptable at its substantial price ,0
 no showers in pool area,0
 The wifi connection was poor ,0
 We never received our wake up call ,0
 Being over charged and them telling me I wasn t telling the truth then rang my bank and they said 2 different payments have been taken out one for the room rate 225 and then an extra 325 Then suddenly they said it s come up on there system saying they charged me twice And all they could off what 25 of what a joke Very disappointed,0
 Prices did seem a bit high a kitkat from the mini bar at 3 50 seemed rather excessive ,0
 Small issue with some staff having very poor English Check In sent us to the wrong room trip back to reception but very helpful and resolved quickly Food and drink is very expensive in the hotel but there are options for cheaper eating next door at the O2 if hotel not in your price range ,0
 The direction indicator to the O2 was not clear it would have been better on the door leading to the venue rather than on the garage notice which made it look as if the entrance was through the garage ,0
 We ordered tea in the morning and was disappointed with the operation of it We asked for a large pot with at least 4 servings We only got 1 cup and saucer lucky there was a mug in the room but we just managed to squeeze out 2 cups of tea All for 12 ,0
 Loved all of it ,0
 Bit out of the way but only short tube ride to central London,0
 The room for the price paid was small to have a King size bed I use intercontinental Hotel for my leisure and business travels a lot in the US thought I would get a similar sized room ,0
 1 member of staff up in the 18th floor bar very rude made me and my lovely wife feel like we were not good enough to be there so spoilt our 25th wedding anniversary treat after a great day and night before hand ,0
 I always usually need a twin room and even though I books a twin I am never down for a twin when I arrive maybe I am doing something wrong I was upgraded to a suite this time which was fabulous The whole set up is quality and I stay here every time I go to a concert at the 02,0
 The room service menu was not great there was not much for people who eat halal I suggest that there should be more on the halal and vegetarian options also more standard foods e g More options for burgers etc,0
 The broadband connection wasn t too good,0
 The restaurant staff were lovely but the service was incredibly slow and some of the food was cold even though the restaurant wasn t at all busy They were very apologetic ,0
 The walking path between N Greenwich tube station and the hotel was not the safest and I would not feel comfortable walking alone there in the dark as no one would be around to hear or help if something bad were to happen It is also not straightforward to get to the ExCeL or landmarks ,0
 The concierge was very friendly and professional and gave a very warm welcome to our hotel ,0
 The only things I can comment on are the coffee maker in the room didn t seem to work even though I got power to it not certain why Swimming pool was too busy on the Sunday morning when I went down to try it but I guess its because it is popular 1000am ,0
 Bar was ordinary for a hotel of this calibre Waited ages to be served to be charged crazy price for glass on wine 20 pound each After waiting 20 mins in line to be served Hotel tried to fix but too little too late ,0
 Slow service in the bar on floor 18 but the staff did try there hardest to accomodate our requests,0
 Service at the bar late evening not the best No initial acknowledgement and slow service Could be improved ,0
 Spa treatments were booked up so we wasn t able to receive any treatments Also the mini fridge in our room was locked so we was unable to put drinks we brought from outside inside the fridge ,0
 Spa treatments and food in the restaurant were a little pricey But to be expected since it s in a nice area of London and a very nice hotel Did want to book the treatments but had a busy weekend planned may have booked it if I stayed for another night ,0
 It was a shame the bar upstairs wasn t open in the afternoon,0
 Thought the mini bar prices were very expensive ,0
 Being old fashioned I like written information on the hotel in the room Would have liked to know in advance how to work the lights and times the pool opened ,0
 Staff let this hotel down was given no information at all upon check in for facilities bars restaurants etc We was told we could order pizza at rooftop bar but then staff up ther said no we couldnt We waited 1 hour just for some chicken skewers When only hand full of ppl in ther ,0
 found the parking prices a little misleading and a misleading quote on wine tray charge think it almost shows that its misleading so you don t realise your being charged which is a shame like making sure you read the small print Very boldly says free valet parking then further down car parking payable at about 24 per day but for a not seasoned traveller I just read free parking maybe have the price and free valet parking in the same section The wine in the room that is outside of the fridge you could wonder if it was a small free bottle of wine the business card with it shows something free but when reading properly its free tray charge should you want a different bottle of wine,0
 GBP 59 per person for Sunday brunch Rooms overall a bit pricey even for London Unattractive long walk from North Greenwich tube station Nearby shops and restaurants cater to the O2 crowd not in keeping with the quality of the hotel These remarks concern the general ambience of the neighbourhood not of course the responsibility of the hotel itself ,0
 Honestly i think everything was good Sorry can t help you in that ,0
 Price hike ,0
 Price of drink in the bars bit pricey,0
 The only minor fault would be the service in the eighteen sky bar Took a little while to get our drinks too ,0
 Breakfast area could have been more luxurious It was a bit over busy and stressful Not a very calm atmosphere,0
 The towels were a little rough they need softening or newer towels ,0
 I was hosting a very small confidential meeting in my room and I ordered a tray of tea coffee to be delivered to the room I received a tray of coffee sachets and tea bags No extra cup ,0
 First room had no view but we were given a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 13th floor with a fabulous view,0
 Lack of information Sat Nav did not have address tried to call for directions phone rang and rang gave up Found that signage to hotel very poor Poor signage into hotel from car park Staff several times gaave us the wrong information such as quickest direction to tube Que at check in and departure with empty desks ,0
 Breakfast was bit pricey as it s a one off price,0
 Check in was a little slow however I think it was just down to timing it was a little disappointing that the lobby bar with the external seating area closed at 11pm it was a beautiful evening and having just attended a concert at the O2 it would have been nice to enjoy a drink outside ,0
 Service in the coffee lounge near reception We ordered scones with cream and jam we waited for almost 45 minutes and when they arrived they were inedible They had clearly been warmed through in a microwave and were of a bready texture When we mentioned this to the member of staff he just said Sorry they are made upstairs I really resented paying 18 for a terrible product which does not represent the hotel very well ,0
 Room card did not work so had to go back to reception Mini bar was locked although had paid on credit card for extras Complimentary bottles of water were not there,0
 Waited nearly 2 hours to get the room we booked should have been able to check in when we arrived as we arrived 3 30pm Broken ironing board had to be reported twice before it was replaced My daughter put a comment on Twitter about the service the manager rang us at 10 30pm the next day as we were climbing into bed after a busy day Offered an apology and fruit Which turned out to be 1 Apple 1 banana and some grapes which we refused Then a member of the hotel staff gave us a nice little wake up call at 3 10 am said hello Mr Hillier and put the phone down So was done deliberately ,0
 Service charges in bar and prices for breakfast were a little steep considering how many restaurants do breakfast in the O2,0
 Booked for a concert at the o2 but the concert got cancelled and there was no way of cancelling without full payment for the room They offered to move the room to the rescheduled concert date but I can t attend on that date and wasn t offered anything else So ended up staying here If you aren t visiting the o2 it s somewhat isolated from London if you are then it s perfect ,0
 Didn t find the food child teenage friendly and a little bit over priced,0
 Paying for parking after you pay a good price for the room as a guest you think it would be free as it s there car park ,0
 It would have been useful to have been given at check in or provided in our room more information about the hotel overall such as the Spa Restaurant s and Bar s it was a shame as we later learnt after wondering around aimlessly that the hotel had brilliant facilities but non of this information was supplied to us at all during our stay we had to discover this for ourselves Poor for a hotel of this size and hierarchy ,0
 Just two capsules of coffee two others were decaff and having used those at 3 30pm i d have expected them to be replaced so we had some for the evening morning But no Would also have expected a hotel like this to change the towels in the evening too especially with temperatures in the 30s No fresh towels no turn down service ,0
 The breakfast price But it was still nice ,0
 Car park floor was filthy rough concrete and dust although being in a wheelchair noticed it more but more like a building site there are ten disabled spaces and everyone was taken by sports cars and Chelsea tractors not one of them had blue badges displayed I had to park at other end of hotel with bags by time I got to check in was rotten Not a good start and paying 24 to park is why I mentioned it ,0
 Could ve done with some instructions re electronics in room but worked it out eventually ,0
 overall excelent service but the only thing was when we were having our breakfast the staff kept trying to clearthe plates when we had nt finished eating it happened a few times,0
 Enjoyed every minute no complaints ,0
 No opening windows or balconies needs adding to their room description ,0
 Could of had a bit more variety of food,0
 That I couldn t stay more days ,0
 The car park charges,0
 Everything was so good ,0
 Price but totally worth it,0
 Very expensive mini bar ,0
 Constructive comment NOT a complaint Would have liked more than one breakfast tea bag as no tea pot provided More milk and a some biscuits would have been good Staying to see a concert at the 02 Arena later meal snack availability would be nice in the Bar after performance ,0
 Air con too hot where broken in the bar but too cold in the downstairs bar where it was working,0
 Bed linen was visibly old tatty in places Bar service as opposed to table service in the Sky Bar on Sunday night then closing at 12 00 far too early for a 5 star London hotel ,0
 Telephoned housekeeping and asked for ice as we had champagne I was asked if small or large bucket and was told it would be sent up to our room asap One hour later it hadn t arrived so i rang again and was told it would be sent up After possibly another hour or so and we rang again The lady we spoke to who said she was from housekeeping was extremely rude denied the request had been made and that was that We never got the ice nor any other contact from housekeeping Not the treatment you would expect from this standard and priced hotel Shame that this let them down ,0
 There are certain things I would expect from a 5 star hotel For example I did not find in the room a hair dryer and neither a toilet brush Probably I could have asked for them but I expected them to be already available in the room The distance between the sink faucet and the bottom of the sink was also really small And the tea and coffee facilities could be better for example I only had decaf coffee in the room and no afternoon tea again I am sure I could have asked for them and I would have received them but this is something I expect to be available without asking in a 5 star hotel However I was really pleased by the kettle and by the brand of tea s as well as by the coffee making facility ,0
 Prices in the Clipper Bar ridiculous,0
 The room had a strange smell in it when we first arrived but this soon seemed to disappear One of the bar men in the Sky Bar was a little strange ,0
 The staf from the moment we got to the door reception and catering staff ,0
 Cocktails very expensive nearly 5 service charge to bring them to you table in the sky lounge which is unecessary,0
 Availability of spa treatments no availability at all over the weekend very disappointing Service in the Clipper Bar left a lot to be desired it was slow lots of staff who seemed to be dashing around whilst achieving very little a number of disgruntled guest at the bar,0
 If I had to complain about anything it was that there was not enough tea bags milk or bottled water although I had a room on my own my daughter s were sharing but there was only 1 still 1 fizzy bottle I think for the price I paid there should have been a bottle each I did mention about the tea bags milk when I was checking out but forgot to say about the water We were also charged for water at the table when we had dinner something else I forgot to mention but we didn t know that we had been charged until I got the bill ,0
 The only thing that we could make a Critisism of and it is minor is the swimming pool could be a few degrees warmer No one was swimming in it at all ,0
 Was informed at reception that we had been upgraded to a river view in which we had already booked and paid for one already,0
 Lack of attention from staff in downstairs restaurant when we arrived who didn t notice our food had not been served them served it cold half an hour later at least No greeting or explanation or menu given at breakfast,0
 The room service menu is very expensive and a mini fridge would be a great addition to the room ,0
 Lack of clarity about room type we paid extra for a river view but initial allocation had poor view room was changed to a much better one but staff mentioned upgrades several time but as far as I know that is what we paid for Booking com booking was vague about this too The so called discretionary service fee of 12 5 was not always appropriate but we did not want to make a fuss ,0
 Would have been good to have a meal in he hotel after the concert at the O2 but it closed orders at 9 30 so we had room service which was very prompt The queue at the sky bar was long even though the staff were flat out and made sure what they served was what you expected ,0
 The heating was a little issue 24c we had the heating on but it took a little too long for us to feel the heat,0
 We chose our room by the picture we saw on booking com which was a lovely big specious deluxe riverside room When we arrived for the check in expecting that room we thought we paid for they said because we booked through booking com they can t guarantee the same room Which was a shame because when we did walk in the room they did gave us it was small comparing to the one they advertised ,0
 Had a problem with the sound on tv only came from the bathroom Was offered to change room by the technician but was too late at night for us to do it as we were tired ,0
 Visited the Sky Bar which I thought was a little over priced and not as welcoming as rest of hotel staff,0
 Steam room wasn t working on the first day ,0
 The price for breakfast is a bit expensive so we went without For a bit cheaper we could travel elsewhere and enjoy something else ,0
 It is a lovely hotel but very expensive for 1 night ,0
 Bar opening hours limited to 6 10pm so missed out on a drink up high with a view ,0
 The shower on our room 1215 was not great Only part of the shower head worked and large amount of the holes were blocked ,0
 Slow service in Clipper Bar and service charge added to an order for 2 lattes which ended up costing 11 00 Not worth the money ,0
 I had to wait a long time to check in the person who checked me in looked like she really did not want to be there very unfriendly and did not engage with me at all or make me feel welcome The bar service in the evening was also very slow and we did not get all of the drinks we ordered ,0
 Not getting loyalty points on my membership as booked through booking com Breakfast was expensive at 25 each so gave it a miss ,0
 Drinks prices are pretty harsh but we were in a luxury hotel in London,0
 Only positive experiences ,0
 Contact lenses from previous person still on bedside table But easily missed My poached eggs were nasty No spa treatment for young teenager Not even nail varnish ,0
 Staff service in bars was very very slow Accommodation is overpriced given location Paying to park at location is not suitable ,0
 N A,0
 We had not a single negative vibe ,0
 Just very expensive considering the location,0
 That we didn t get told that parking was 25 on check out if said at front desk as we stayed at hotel we ended up paying 45,0
 Charged different prices for same drinks was told it would be lookedible into and someone woUldale phone us but never heard a thing Sent email as left phone charger in room again never heard a thing ,0
 12 5 discretionary service isn t discretionary it is automatically added to every transaction ,0
 None of the restaurants were available for us on the day as there was a corporate event going on that took over the restaurants There was a bar serving snacks but we had planned a nice 3 course meal we had looked at the menu for the restaurant online and decided to have a late lunch early dinner before the evening show We were advised that we could have room service but a nice three course meal is not so nice of your laps in the bedroom ,0
 That I didn t stay for longer ,0
 The drinks were a little bit expensive ,0
 We felt the breakfast was not worth the high price,0
 I guess I was expecting more from a 5star I wouldn t say the room was any better than a travelodge ,0
 Leaving and come back to reality,0
 We attended a concert at the O2 and after we wanted to go to the Sky bar We were unable to go to it earlier as it was closed for a private function However due to the amount of people coming from the O2 both residents and non residents we were turned away as it was at capacity Whilst we understand this from a safety point of view we feel that hotel residents should get priority from those people who had just decided to walk across from the O2 It was one of the hotel features that we were looking forward to experiencing ,0
 Bit over the top pricing in certain aspects ,0
 Cannot think of anything that could have been better Sure it s a bit pricey but you get what you pay for so well worth it ,0
 The Bed it is not confortable at all mattress was very stiff and the pillows where a nightmare to sleep with ,0
 The price of the drinks in the bar The addition of the service charge on each order of table serviced drinks in the sky at not just once st the end ,0
 No complaints it s a great hotel and we will definitely come back ,0
 Dodgy phone reception Window view was not good Lighting system was unclear ,0
 The view could ve been better we were on the 3rd floor and all we could see out of our window was air conditioning and some stairs thats it no view whatsoever But that wasn t an issue as such the room was perfect,0
 What s not to like ,0
 The staff did not seem professional We had to ask for too many things that should be in place Maybe a bit unorganised Had expected more from a 4 to 5 star hotel ,0
 Our check in was a little late and although sorted promptly when we went to check in at 3 05 after arriving at 2pm and having a drink at the bar we were told our room was not yet ready once we spoke up about needing our room as we had plans to get out promptly we were then given rooms it would have just been More pleasant and efficient to sort that out before telling us that our rooms were not ready especially as they were aware we had arrived in good time and had been in the bar for an hour ,0
 Free parking would of been nice but not a problem,0
 The only thing we didn t like is we had to pay ha ha,0
 Bar prices are very high and the mini bar prices were ridiculous It would have been nice to have biscuits in the room to have with early morning tea coffee ,0
 when we went for breakfast which was not cheap all the cooked food was cold so we could not eat it we were told by waiter to get some more but it also was cold we spoke to the restaurant manager and he just said you should have just got some but it was cold The point being that it should not have been cold in the first place and freshly cooked its a 5 star hotel and we expected better it ended our experience with you on a low we spoke to the customer liaison staff and they said they would look into it and get back to me but no reply from them on saying that the overall experience was amazing thank you ,0
 Didn t like sky bar never liked any of them at any hotels Always feel like I shouldn t be in there and it s an elite club ,0
 Couldn t fault anything on our visit ,0
 The sat nav in my new car Qashqui would not accept the postcode off the web site There is a lack of signage to the hotel on the roundabout as you approach Millennium Way The cooked breakfast although there was a good selection of stuff was luke warm The room although equipped with a coffee maker only had two teabags and a couple of sachets of sugar about half teaspoon of white and brown We went up to the bar on the 18th floor and had one drink each because the drinks were sooooo sooooo very very expensive The music in the bar was awful very repetitive boom boom trance music not at all relaxing or pleasant ,0
 Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful ,1
 No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,1
 Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back ,1
 Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character ,1
 Amazing location and building Romantic setting ,1
 Good restaurant with modern design great chill out place Great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs ,1
 The room is spacious and bright The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park ,1
 Good location Set in a lovely park friendly staff Food high quality We Oth enjoyed the breakfast ,1
 The room was big enough and the bed is good The breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling ,1
 Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too ,1
 Style location rooms,1
 Comfy bed good location ,1
 This hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The breakfast selection was spectacular All considered this was a great hotel for the price and I plan to return ,1
 It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it ,1
 This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good ,1
 Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic ,1
 We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,1
 Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues ,1
 I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee ,1
 Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area ,1
 The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,1
 The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable ,1
 Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly ,1
 Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning ,1
 Great location in the park near museums and restaurants Perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips Beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms Big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right Friendly and helpful staff I m,1
 The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around ,1
 Great hotel original concept style,1
 The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits ,1
 The hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the hotel Public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close Good wifi all around the hotel ,1
 The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning ,1
 Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern ,1
 The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible ,1
 The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing,1
 Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great ,1
 the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park,1
 Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,1
 The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,1
 Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ,1
 The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything ,1
 Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous ,1
 Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk ,1
 Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back,1
 The brunch to purchase in the morning was good ,1

 Massive bed,1
 The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in ,1
 The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone ,1
 clean and new,1
 My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night ,1
 The location and views ,1
 The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat,1
 Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly,1
 good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepction,1
 The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend ,1
 location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed ,1
 Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam Room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly ,1
 The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really ,1
 Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me ,1

 To begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise Breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after It has undergone some major renovations since I last stayed there The new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property Super impressed with the Park and the way nature comes together with the hotel New dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing ,1
 Beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff Quick tram to leidseplein and Metro to central ,1
 The bath and shower room was amazing Beautiful hotel They are going through a refebishment at the moment and I am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which I think will look even more stunning then the building is already,1

 Lovely hotel with lots of history Great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bed,1
 The whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly The dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well The room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again ,1
 The location on the park is excellent and very peaceful The restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee ,1
 Funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed ,1
 Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning ,1
 We have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms There are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special Our room 065 was just gorgeous ,1
 The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel ,1
 Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room ,1
 We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc ,1
 The room was lovely great hotel beautiful location ,1
 The restaurant opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger Good breakfast with fresh orange juice WIFI in all hotel,1
 Beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms Staff a very helpful and chatty It s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer,1
 The bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss The food was absolutely gorgeous ,1
 Pretty building interesting rooms ,1
 Room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint Free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences ,1
 rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain A lot more interesting and quirky,1
 Large bed ,1
 It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished ,1
 Good location Cheap ,1
 Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion ,1
 Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast ,1
 Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center ,1
 We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds ,1
 A very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location Bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding ,1
 beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different,1
 Location,1
 Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll ,1
 The bed was amazing Actually our whole room large room The park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven ,1

 The rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well Restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from ,1
 Good water pressure in shower,1
 The hotel is located in a very nice area of Amsterdam There are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city Staff were very kind ,1
 We upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub ,1
 Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful,1
 Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,1
 Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,1
 Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night ,1
 This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel ,1
 Very friendly staff lovely comfy room,1
 food recommendations were brilliant,1
 The inside of the hotel is very classy He staff are friendly and helpful Our room was great Huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed The hotel is a nice area There is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the Heineken Experience ,1
 Bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to The hotel was warm and beautifully decorated We were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice,1
 The location of this hotel is great It s very close to the tram lines and subway The staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking The breakfast buffet was fine ,1
 Breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc Next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby Staff very friendly willing to help ,1
 Well located if you don t mind taking the train ,1
 this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,1

 Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky room ,1
 The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle ,1
 Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel Got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant ,1

 Very smart room good food ,1
 Breakfast Staff,1
 staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked ,1

 Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff ,1
 Good Wi fi ,1
 Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building ,1

 Character of the hotel was great Location was good,1
 Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel ,1
 The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great ,1
 friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins,1
 This was our first time in Amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful They took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly ,1

 Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram ,1

 It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus ,1
 The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect ,1
 Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction ,1
 The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome ,1
 We liked the location and the extra pleasant staff They were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows ,1
 I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable ,1
 The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful shower,1
 Got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town ,1
 We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights Hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes Hotel is situated in a quite area The rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy The staff is very nice and helpful,1
 Really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at 6am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airport,1
 The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home ,1
 Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes ,1
 Great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food ,1
 This is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay There is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history Also the shower was incredible ,1
 We loved our stay at hotel arena The hotel was great Staff was really kind especially for Job the guy encharged of the restaurant and Sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk Talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and I got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel That night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room It was a very classy detail We were so thankful about it Also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant Food is great Thank u for everything hotel arenaaa ,1

 Perfect Location Great value Very comfortable beds We arrived very early and they allowed us to use the fitness center to shower freshen up which we thought was great Nice lobby Right next to Earls Court Tube stop so plenty of travel links Tube train bus etc plenty of shops and restaurants in the area ,1
 Lovely hotel with friendly staff Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with good powerful shower and underfloor heating We had a room overlooking the garden which was nice Excellent location Would definitely stay here again ,1
 The price per night is very good relatively to other 4 stars hotels in London The location is very good 2 minutes walk from Earl s Court metro station at Piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in London direct from the Heathrow airport And to all the popular locations in London Near the Hotel there is 2 big supermarket 4 5 good restaurants and 3 cafes The hotel very clean modern and new The breakfast very good not too expensive for full English Breakfast 15 per person At any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more The bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean This is my second time I m staying in the k k hotels in Europe they are very good ,1

 Location,1
 Excellent location for the price less than 5 mins walking to Earl s Court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the Piccadilly line good breakfast,1
 The staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill 20 metres and down 20 metres down its a accident waiting to happen ,1
 Its central location its proximity to metro station 3 min walk to Earl s Court Underground Station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides,1
 Everything a boutique hotel should be Well located on a quiet side street 1 minute walk to Earls Court station Tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design Really impressive My single room was quite small but well laid out I WILL go back Liked it the best of 30 hotels I ve stayed in London ,1
 Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away ,1
 Hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained,1
 very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds,1
 Staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean ,1
 Bar area and Reception good,1
 We love everything about the Hotel George the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 I think that speaks for itself ,1
 On this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal ,1
 I went to London to visit my niece who was studying in London This hotel was ideally located in Earl s Court close to her apartment and the tube station Very nice hotel and staff Nice selection of food at breakfast Located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at Earl s Court ,1
 Room was OK if a little small and this was a King Executive Tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable I requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated ,1
 Location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed ,1
 Very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden I like the fact that it is a small hotel Plus I like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower ,1

 Great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like Austrian apple strudel ,1

 Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court Where to start From the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start The hotel is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and for location alone is great value I had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner It s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the London eye The apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans Pringles and of course the apex duck We had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay They really have thought about everything We have stayed in many hotels in London but would definately choose apex again ,1
 It was located in a cosy corner off the street ,1
 The staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely,1
 Very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard Terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet I imagine Very pleasant staff and good hotel bar I didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment ,1
 Beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent ,1
 The location of the hotel is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket ,1
 The staff were fantastic in the bar super friendly The shower and bath were fantastic ,1
 Staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm Good location to walk around London ,1

 I spend the weekend in the Apex Hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from Apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london For this THANK YOU SO MUCH We will come back Best regards Theresa,1
 Rooms are quiet Beds are huge Bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud ,1
 Comfortable room which was very clean,1
 Everything from the reception greeting of Luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception The cleaning staff were polite and warm My standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room ,1
 Very comfortable and clean room Balcony was a little plus ,1
 Alex Hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a Junior suite which was amazing Free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh ,1
 Hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional The room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus Our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything Also had to love the Apex duck Would definately recommend staying in an Apex hotel ,1
 location would have been great,1
 Room was a nice size and very quiet Quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there We were in room 149 which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing ,1
 The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries ,1
 Location of the hotel,1
 Really lovely and luxurious hotel Special thanks to Gosia on Reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you Gosia ,1
 The room was really completely sound proof We appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes And if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack The superior rooms are equipped with a Bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable ,1
 Excellent location good standard of hotel Professional service,1
 Location was reason for booking and was spot on Staff were all very pleasant Time was spent out and about as we were visiting friends and family so didn t use facilities or eat breakfast Room was clean and tidy with great black out curtains Check out swift and easy ,1
 Location of the hotel is fantastic The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are very helpful The room was massive particularly considering its location in London The breakfast had a great selection and was perfect to prepare for a long day walking around London ,1
 Great hotel in good location fairly near theatres St Paul s Tate Modern The City River Thames The Shard half hour walk to Trafalgar Square a bit more to Soho Oxford St Nice to walk along the river to Westminster or get a boat 10 15min taxi from St Pancras Fairly quiet district for London but not much happening in the immediate location ,1
 Given special permission to use hotel parking alongside blue badge holding parents many thanks for this convenience ,1
 Room was very spacious and clean with all the facilities that you need Bed was very comfortable as well The surroundings is very quiet as the hotel has a innercourt and is not directly situated on a busy road,1
 The bed really confortable Location is good walking distance to tube and train ,1
 Room was gorgeous and very clean Lovely big bed High quality furnishings and technology and air con as well which was an unexpected bonus ,1
 Location and price so close to Christmas was awesome room upgrade on arrival was much appreciated after a long and difficult flight Staff very welcoming and attentive helped us with our bags and shopping when we checked in and out were on hand to order taxis and help It was also quiet and out of the way despite the central location ,1
 It is tucked away but near to public transport The staff were friendly efficient and helpful Their restaurant had a great selection at reasonable prices Beds comfortable very clean and we had a lovely walk in shower ,1
 What didn t we like about the hotel it was beautiful We loved everything at the Apex we couldn t ask for any more the staff were so lovely friendly The food and the cocktails were amazing made with the best ingredients the room was beautiful and amazing so modern and comfy just never wanted to leave the room The nights sleep was one of the best we ve had in ages And the Elemis free toiletries was a lovely touch Elemis is a amazing brand to use ,1

 The front desk and entrance was very nice and the staff were helpful ,1
 they transfer me to The Park Grand London Kensington due to maintance work at The Park Grand London Paddington they offer me a free ride to Kensington a soft drink while im i watting the taxi and includ the breakfast in my stay which that im not applied for it Park Grand London Kensington newer and bigger than Park Grand London Paddington Underground station 3 mins walk People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference the handy phone that comes with the room The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron ,1
 This is my second time staying at this Hotel The first time I was on business This time it was for mini holiday The bed is very comfortable The room and bathroom very clean and spacious The location is very convenient Very good selection at breakfast ,1
 Very handy location to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express and in the pretty Paddington area This hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated The staff are wonderful thank you And the English breakfast was excellent Not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal Equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh Good Indian and European cuisine ,1
 The room was small but we knew that before arrival I just didn t think that paying an extra 40 for a room that I wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it The wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it The hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair Parking was a nightmare as you have to park 10 minutes away and trudge back with your luggage This wasn t mentioned before booking I wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under Waitrose and was 40 for two night The price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage The location was good close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab ,1
 The free breakfast every morning that came with the stay The staff in the restaurant were wonderful ,1
 Hyde Park and public transport are in close proximity we used Bayswater station everyday Staff is really helpful supported us in printing boarding passes The pub across the street is great The room is small but probably good for value because of price and location ,1
 The drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced,1
 Great transport system nearby especially from the airport LHR Customer service is excellent,1
 Location shower,1
 Good Aircon Comfy bed Brilliant shower,1
 Good shower and toiletries Air conditioning Big window and pleasant outlook Towels and sheets clean and good quality Apples available at reception Iron available from reception desk ,1
 Good location Staff was good ,1
 location not too bad access to tube and rail confusing with another hotel in group within close proximity went to book into wrong hotel interior bit tired and then we were in the room at the top of the building so bit dark Bathroom facilities strange with wet room set up but not ideal with curtain and door so close ,1
 The space is good for a family of 4 The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron ,1
 The hotel location is excellent It is super close to the Paddington train and tube stations It is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy You walk three streets south and you are next to the Hyde Park Kensington Gardens gate I had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items My room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away ,1
 Very friendly helpful staff Room was cleaned well Beautiful building in a quiet area of Paddington with good facilities nearby,1
 The room was very modern and clean Staff were also very friendly and made our stay extra special ,1
 Convenient location very clean and modern good coffee helpful staff,1
 The location was perfect,1
 I expected a budget room to be small but this really was v small cramped Not enough space for suitcase shower area adequate Hidden wardrobe drop down desk useful Bed however very comfortable indeed Staff exceptionally helpful which made up for the minute sized room ,1
 Rooms way to small bathrooms also small ,1
 Quiet pleasant location a few minutes walk from Paddington station Good sized room and bathroom ,1
 A great hotel in a beautiful old terrace building We had a club room which was modern and spacious with large windows Bed was amazingly comfortable Walking distance to Paddngton Station and Heathrow Express ,1
 Very helpful and accomodating staff Lovely to have a valet to carry my bag to and from my room and get me a cab The concierge desk was very helpful Was given free breakfast each day after having to be moved to their sister hotel just a short distance down the street due to a broken boiler in my booked hotel ,1
 Short walk from Kensington Gardens and Paddington Station Lots of coffee shops and restaurants in the vicinity Helpful friendly staff at reception Especially the lady from Armenia Was first put into a small rooftop room but then given a bigger room on lower floor with huge ceilings ,1
 Good location within 10 minutes walk of Paddington Quiet location with great facilities and pleasant staff Easy access to travel points and only 5 minutes from Kensington Gardens ,1
 I booked a triple room The room is quiet large and has a balcony The location is really nice Near the paddinton station just about 5 minutes walk and hyde park The staff are very very friendly and they will try to meet all your need I order two room services and the food is really delicious breakfast is also very nice I will definitely choose this hotel again when I go to London next time ,1
 The friendliness of the staff was exceptional They wanted our visit to be the best and my daughter who was 6 months pregnant received special treatment Breakfast was very good ,1
 The bed is super comfortable I could close the curtains and make it very dark make tea in the morning in teapot there And of course it is very clean ,1
 A compact but well furnished room with a very comfortable bed good lights and an excellent shower ,1
 A nice hotel in a very convenient location Very clean People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference I also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room Very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries All this made up for the price which I initally thought a bit too much and I still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted 120 a night for a compact room If I paid the full amount I would think it is overpriced but I guess that s London in the summer ,1
 The club room is comfortable for 2 Clean and bright The room seems to be newly furbished The toilet is spacious too ,1
 OMG What a tiny tiny room You could not walk around the bed without walking sideways No room for anything No barfridge Appalling really when they tout themselves as being boutique ,1
 The staff were friendly and polite The location was ideal for commuting in and out of the centre of London easily There were ample places to go for a meal within walking distance ,1
 the hotel was close to the underground and some nice resturants,1
 The rooms have been renovated to look quite nice and are representative of the photos but they re not at all functional to stay in They ve placed extra furniture items in the room in an attempt to correct this but that just makes the spaces cluttered and not all of the additional items are functional either i e additional robe placed in dark entrance mostly filled up by the ironing board hard to see into damp smell emanating from it and makes accessing room awkward I ended up checking out after one night as I was there for 5 days and had work commitments so ease of use with the room was important to me ,1
 The room was huge and very quiet,1
 A mostly very young staff were very helpful and added to the stay ,1
 Staff in Restaurant were very helpful at Breakfast with Gluten Free Diet Selection of food was very good ,1
 Friendly staff and easy to walk to the tube clean rooms,1
 We actually stayed at Grand Royal Hyde Park as there was a problem with the boiler at Paddington one To make up for transfer they gave us free drinks while we waited for the taxi they gave us and gave us free breakfasts at the Hyde Park It was a beautiful hotel ornate turned wood stained glass windows beautiful painted ceilings like being in Rome the staff were polite happy to help and give us information looked after our bag on checkout day until we left London at 7pm Breakfast was in a beautiful large room plentiful full cooked or continental fresh croissants anything you could possibly want The room was very comfortable complete with kettle and fridge and wardrobe View wasn t great overlooked an alley but it was light and quiet no street noise All manner of shops and cafes and the tube just around the corner And Hyde park 50 metres away I would definitely recommend this to others ,1
 Paddington is a beautiful suburb and unbelievably quiet for London Rooms are a reasonable size for London and the window could actually be opened which makes a nice change Complimentary fruit water was also a nice touch Definitely would return to this hotel,1
 The location of the hotel was brilliant the area felt safe and there were shops and cafes with friendly staff Hyde Parks a stones throw away was perfect and a short power walk to Oxford Street instead of public transport The hotel was accessible friendly staff and had good amenities ,1
 Location of the propert was fantastic and near the tube stations Staff was fantastic and even the breakfast seemed over staffed Rooms are modern clean and even presented a complimentary coffee as we waited for our room Luxurious and well price for central London ,1
 very comfortable room and excellent staff They welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions It was not expensive either I am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels Theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well Overall an excellent and cozy experience ,1
 Modern room good location helpful staff ,1
 I am very fond of Bayswater location Breakfast was ok and serving and cleaning tables was quick ,1
 The hotel offered guest a cell wifi mobile app with map and gps ,1
 Everything had a nice feel to it The staff were friendly and were always smiling and laughing ,1
 The Porter staff were very friendly the receptionists didn t seem to care ,1
 The Hotel is in walking distance from Paddington Station and so to Heathrow That s my reason for using this hotel ,1
 The hotel was perfect for a short stay in the heart of London very conveniently located for Paddington station and the Heathrow Express Highly recommended ,1
 location is nice and surrounding is also pretty comfortable to find aynthing,1
 The property is conveniently located near Paddington station It was very easy to get to the airport by Heathrow express ,1
 When we arrived at the hotel we were told that there were problems with the boiler so we would have to stay in another hotel of the chain London Grand Paddington Court We were offered a complimentary breakfast for noth days The following review is of the hotel where we ended up staying which was the London Grand Paddington Court Instead of the twin beds our room had a double Everything else was as advertised good shower tea and coffee ironing facilites We did enjoy our stay but having to share a bed was an inconvience The breakfast was delicious ,1
 Really good location Very friendly staff and very helpful We were meeting our son whose birthday it had been recently and we wanted to surprise him with a cake and candles We asked if we could do this in the hotel bar and they not only agreed but also whisked the cake away lit the candles and brought it out to surprise him once we were seated in the bar Excellent ,1
 The location was great being close to Paddington station The rooms are really nice and very comfortable ,1
 Convenient location and friendly staff,1

 If you wanna stay near paddington in a buget This s good idea But to be honest I wish I just book Hilton instead ,1
 Location and Value for money,1
 Great location near Paddington very friendly staff Good simple breakfast Excellent value for the price ,1
 For the price paid 1 2 normal rate I thought this was a good value hotel Plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities The room was smallish but well laid out I stayed for one night The location is great and if you re visiting London for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at Paddington ,1
 The hotel was in a nice quiet location just 5 mins walk from Paddington station The staff were lovely and allowed us to check out very early for our flight at 7am The room was a decent size and very modern with a comfortable bed ,1
 Excelllent view out to Cleveland Square quiet extremely helpful staff at all times of day and evening good furnishings of room 317 Good magazine supply Nice atmosphere in lounge bar Above all the excellent room and its fittings Mind the ingenuity of the designer in fitting so much into the space of 317 made it a very different experience than staying in one of the larger upgraded room suites of my last stay there Both are fine just radically different ,1
 The staff were really friendly especially Sara We would definitely come and stay here again because of her ,1
 Great staff and value for money Hotel was lovely although there were a few stains on the curtains This did not bother me that much however other guests may not be so forgiving ,1
 Ideal location for Paddington station and the parks And only a good walk to the west end weather permitting Greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming Rooms were small but well appointed Lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good No public space to relax Apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar We didn t eat breakfast But the food we saw looked very good The staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp We as a family enjoyed our time here,1
 Best Value for Money in a Hotel in London within a walkable distance to Oxford street The Reception staff were excellent the boys were probably the best in UK as they handled our luggage all the way during check in checkout Room is small but good ,1
 I like the quality of service room decoration staff was friendly Moreover they provided me storage option which was very comfortable specially if you have trains to heathrow Overall i had a great experience staying there ,1

 We stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central London Central line tube and bus stop only a 4 5 min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions Considering the location it is pretty quiet at night This time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost We have stayed in lots of places in London but will definitely stay here again ,1
 I enjoyed my time in the hotel everything were perfect and great breakfast was very well the staff very kindly especially tina and diana I will stay more and more in that hotel again ,1

 Nice hotel Room was beautiful and bed very comfortable Did not expect big rooms in Paris so size was really ok with 2 windows Bathroom modern and new with a GREAT shower Staff was wonderfull since reservation They sent me an email prior to my arrival asking if they could help me in anyway and also asking if I had any special needs such as extra beds I had a last minute health problem in the family and had to arrive one day earlier and stay for 1 night less Audrey was wonderful and managed to receive me before and dealt herself with Booking to change my reservation I sent a note to her when I was entering my flight from Cannes to Paris and when I left the airplane she had already sorted everything out They even charged me a lower rate as on the day I arrived the room costed a little less In this same day Saturday June 25 I went out with friends and arrived really hungry at the hotel at 1 30AM and the guy from reception can t believe I forgot his name Maybe Hadesmi managed to open the restaurant and get to my room a nice aspargus risoto bread yougurt and a warm smile even thought riom service finishes at midnight Really had a very nice experience at Monhotel and recomend it ,1
 Fantastic weekend with my partner We Would definitely stay here again Location was excellent and couldn t have asked for a better area to stay in Was so close to the metro and all the shops bars and restaurants Room was lovely and cosey and very modern with a classy edge to the facility ,1
 Good location really good breakfast maybe the best I ever had in Paris in a confortable and stylish setting Everything you need is provided on site you can literally arrive with your hands in your pockets Helpfull and attentive staff ,1

 Mon Hotel is a charming boutique hotel located near Champs Elysees in a little street coming from l Avenue des Grand Armees near the Bus Direct stop airport shuttle The metro station Argentine line 1 is just 2 min away and it can lead you everywhere in town Very nice caf s and restaurants near by though not the most glamourous neighborhood you can find in Paris The mini market Le Marche d Etoile offers fresh fruits and all the basic things one might need The street is very quiet and the hotel is located in a very nice classical building The service at the reception is great loved it the staff is really helpful The room is so confy specially the bed Air conditioning works great as well as the wifi To end up the best features every room has a smartphone where you can navigate freely in and out of the hotel amazing right and before your stay the hotel sends you an email asking for your guest needs explaining how to get there nearby restaurants and attractions never experienced this kind of service before I was really WOWed Highly recommended ,1
 Room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after 11pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound They gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free 4g internet and free calls over the Europe and North America it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in Paris Staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on It is litterally 5minutes from Arc de Triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay 10 euro to get on top of it and you can see a Paris from there its absolutely beutiful Metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about 2euro but it can bring you anywhere Really nice location highly recommended ,1
 The hotel brings a high style of modernity and glamour The staff is always ready to help in anything and the amazing location between the turistic and business area in Paris ,1
 Location is excellent and quite easy accessible for tourists travelling by car with parking in the vicinity Staff diligent and responsive Rooms are well equipped and they have a nice hotel bar ,1

 We generally loved this hotel We d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in Bloomsbury before So we thought we d try staying there The location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from Heathrow was do able The hotel s Victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the Titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room The staff was very helpful ,1
 The Hotel Russell is a rare survivor of a bygone era Few hotels today can match the historical opulence of the Russell Hotel It is worth a visit if only to have a drink at the bar ,1

 Hotel Russell is my preferred hotel in London The Piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel Russell station and then you are in the central part of London close to the British Museum and many historic sites The hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations The only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan ,1

 The hotel is clean The staff is very friendly The room was relatively big so I had space to move around The staff is super friendly and the Location is perfect The tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus For example you might think that being close to Kings Cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least 10 minutes and that s if you get the exit right Switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location It s also located in front of Russel Square Park which is very nice ,1

 Just the location and view,1
 Around the corner from the London eye and used it for a Trafalgar trip as the pickup for our tour was around the corner Walked down to the Borough market and took a river cruise to Greenwich Plent of eating spots close by as well Over the bridge was Westminster Abbey Parliament House and Big Ben and walked to Trafalgar Square as well also a laundry available which is very helpful ,1
 You re always my hotel of choice You re staff are incredible and recently you ve been giving me wonderful upgrades I always recommend you and when work ask me if I have a preference of accommodation you re my first pick I ve been staying with you for years so thank you,1
 The staff were all excellent The reception staff especially they went out of their way to make the kids feel welcome ,1

 Room was very well appointed and facilities were good,1
 Staff was very helpful Restaurant offered great food Excellent location walking distance to Waterloo station and several landmarks ,1
 Were staying in london for just one night and the location was perfect we paid around 200 for one night for a family suite and it was very well worth the money ,1
 Location,1
 Location was great easy walk to London eye and Big Ben as well as many other attractions in this area hotel staff were great very helpful breakfast buffet was very good food was very fresh and well presented and although very busy staff were very efficient to make sure every one was well looked after ,1
 location to city attractions The room was comfortable and quiet Bathroom was clean and the hot water in the shower was plentiful ,1
 the location is the perks here it is walking distance to the london eye and everything near it it is also about a 10 minute walk away from the nearest tube station there are many little cafes nearby so overall it is really convenient ,1
 It was a great stay for me and my family everybody in the hotel was so helpful especially COURTNEY at the reception desk Everything in the hotel was excellent including breakfast When we go to London again we will definitely stay in this hotel ,1
 Convenience location 10 mins walk to Waterloo tube station 3 mins to London eye Suggest to choose a room with outside view finally paid 20 per night to upgrade ,1
 LOCATION perfect STAFF we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the Park Plaza Building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel It wasn t The staff at the Park Plaza Westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming Their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the Park Plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back They were all smiley and happy to assist us On the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright The lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready It was a quick 10min wait which was fine No greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the Spectrum Bar It was 1500H and the bar was definitely not busy The difference between our experience between the staff from both Park Plaza Hotels was just really evident that I had to put it here ROOM SUPERIOR Room We stayed for our anniversary We got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels We were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night The TV monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc The bedroom and bath were just the right size It was not small but not too big as well We didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right Mini bar was stocked with the basics We liked that there were extra pillows for us to use Bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean BREAKFAST good old continental and english breakfast ,1
 Great staff comfortable quiet rooms Breakfast upstairs was good ,1
 We had a horrible stay Nothing other than location satisfied ,1
 I liked that there were crockery cutlery a microwave in the room,1
 The location is fantastic about 10 minutes walk to the Waterloo Station and London Eye The Studio Double room is made up of 2 smaller rooms interconnected by a mini kitchenette There are kitchenware and microwave for use One room consist of a queen size bed and a sofa bed in the other Suitable for family of 4 There is a public laundry room for those who would like their laundry to be done ,1
 Plenty of room in the studio double Comfy bed Great location to Westminster sights and right off the Waterloo tube stop ,1
 Nice breakfast and dinner avaliable,1

 Breakfast was awesome Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful The Bar Restaurant was very convenient and provided great service Loved the food and drinks they had to offer The bedroom and shower was nice I enjoyed my stay and would definitely book a room at Park Plaza County Hall next time I m in town In terms of location you can t beat it all the landmarks are within walking distance and Waterloo station is just around the corner so you can get around town on the tube very easily ,1
 The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable ,1
 Great location and helpful porters and concierge staff ,1

 Welcoming staff on the front desk Very helpeful Amazing location and view from bedroom ,1
 Great central location 5 min walk from London eye Big Ben Waterloo station Very clean hotel and great service ,1
 The kitchenette in the room is just the thing a family needs The view of London Eye is great The staff is quite responsive to all needs This includes everyone from front desk restaurant housekeeping and concierge They were very courteous and helpful to us The breakfast is very good too A lot of variety The hotel location is the best part Very close to the Waterloo station A number of trains to places outside of London originate terminate here Couple of bus stops are also nearby Westminster bridge London Eye and other tourist attractions on the river bank are just a short walk The county hall area has a few decent restaurants a starbucks and a convenience store The booking com offer of free entry tickets to various attractions saved us a lot of money It is a very good offer ,1
 Little extras made a big difference It was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable There were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved We were a towel short 1 evening 1 phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within 5 minutes The location is superb 5 minutes walk from Waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the London Eye the South Bank a bridge walk to either Westminster or Soho We were on the 13th floor we could have been in the country It was quiet no road or plane noise at all ,1
 Loved the location close to two subway stations big rooms with microwave gym and sauna Aurora spa services also great Liked the good security on entering the property Would go back again Especially with families ,1
 Superb location and excellent room,1
 Breakfast was just okay Family suite was perfect Pretty quiet even at night Close to all major London attractions except Greenwich Shakespeare s globe but we walked there just fine ,1
 Great Stay Superb Location Comfy Beds Good English Breakfast Friendly Staff front desk ,1
 Location was helpful cleanliness was average reception was nice ,1
 The bed was a good size and the sofa bed was good Good with nespresso machine and microwave We ended up with good big windows and a light room ,1
 Staff were exceptional I wish there were a higher rating Friendly and chatty while still being highly efficient and making sure our stay was perfect This hotel is an ideal spot for a trip to London we could walk a large majority of places we wanted to go but still very quiet and restful The kitchenette is a lively touch we didn t cook but it apenabled us to store snacks cereal etc And milk and water on the fridge Plenty of wardrobe and storage space Bathroom shower in particular was excellent Breakfast each morning was great and though there are a large number of peopl 14 floors highly organised and efficient Wifi was great easily able to stream Netflix etc And there was a big screen TV with many apps and all the premium channels ,1
 I have been several times in London This is my best hotel stay Close to everything ,1
 The location can t be beaten The separation between the two beds allows parents to hang out in one side of the room while the kids sleep in peace on the other side ,1
 Staff at breakfast were very good Concierge staff security staff were excellent very helpful Good breakfast for the money ,1
 Room was comfortable but very small More intimate than private but clean and tidy Shower difficult to use and poor screen means it leaks on the bathroom floor Compact sink but all in all everything you need and hotel affords a great location ,1
 Proximity excellent,1
 We were greeted so warmly and treated like old friends by the chef upon our late arrival to the restaurant the first night He was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and made us feel very welcome and special ,1
 I like the Location that is close to London Eye Big Ben and the Themes I like the nice room size ,1
 The staff was extra helpful and friendly The breakfast was good and the chef made sure we got what we wanted I also like that the hotel was close to where we wanted to be ,1
 Complimentary upgrade to suite well received Room absolutely perfect especially after long working day Location is great for South Bank and County Hall exhibitions and conferences ,1
 The room was lovely Small by American standards but to be expected in Europe The beds were very comfy and the room has a coffee and refrigeration station Plenty of storage for your clothing and bags Perfect room for 2 people Lovely hotel Would stay here again Location is superb ,1
 Doorman was very helpful obtaining a taxi for a early morning flight Helped with our luggage and opening the taxi doors for myself and my travel buddy ,1
 The hotel staff were lovely and I loved the layout of the room Also my mother called in to do something special for my birthday and the hotel staff were great about it Big thank you to them ,1
 Comfy beds and sheets huge room with fridge and microwave two tellies Very polite and helpful reception staff ,1
 We had a corner room on the 11th floor with two large windows Spectacular views of Big Ben Palace of Westminster the London Eye and the city skyline over the Waterloo train station This location is awesome to go to all the Southbank attractions restaurants Waterloo train underground station Westminster Bridge and longer walks along the Thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city Summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after 9 30 pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of Pimm s at the Southbank Centre almost every night The room was spacious especially for a hotel in London and the bed was large and comfy This is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat The staff were super friendly and very helpful We didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel ,1
 Nothing in particular,1
 This is the first time I d stayed in this hotel but it certainly won t be the last From the staff on the reception desk and the concierges to the staff in the Italian restaurant I could find no faults Everyone was very welcoming and friendly By London standards the twin bedded room was surprisingly spacious and the bed pillows so comfortable ,1
 The way we were checked in by Mariah giving us a good room and making our wedding anniversary so special ,1
 This hotel was very nice a great location near Westminster Bridge for city access The breakfast was very good A bonus was the free laundry for guests which was great after 2 weeks on the road The concierge was very friendly helpful as were the baggage guys on the front door ,1
 We didnt like our first room It was too dark but for more money we got shifted to a bigger room with great light We had continual problems with the tv volume Everytime we turnef it on we had to call maintenance to fix the volume That was annoying The buffet breakfast was excellent but room service meal terrible They refunded our meal though ,1
 Ideal location just a stones through from Waterloo Station Clean rooms beautiful bathroom Kettle fridge sink which was handy and iron ironing board in the room which was nice Two TV s was a nice touch so that people in both parts of the room could watch TV Comfortable bed too ,1
 Modern rooms close to nearly tube station and a short walk to the London Eye Great location if you want to be close to tourist hot spots but dont want to stay in a super busy area Clean and suitable rooms ,1
 The staff on duty in the lobby and at the front desk were GREAT ,1
 Nice central location lovely view from our bedroom most staff were very welcoming and nice ,1
 I liked the room layout because the bath room kitchen separated the room with the queen size bed and the living room which had a pull out couch that our 19 year old son stayed in ,1
 The cleanliness of the whole location ,1
 Bar staff were attentive and service great,1
 Extremely clean modern and updated great room set up for a family with two children The double bed is in one room and the kids have a fold out couch in the other ,1
 The location was great Close to major attractions and transport We enjoyed the breakfasts We heard very little noise from Waterloo Station despite our room overlooking it ,1
 Amazing Staff Great customer service Spacious clean and comfortable room ,1
 Plenty of selection at breakfast Attentive staff ,1
 Comfortable bed and a good sized room Able to make hot drinks and having an ice machine in the hallway was a bonus Water and sweets were left for us on arrival Staff dealt with problems with the room quickly Could to see part of the London Eye and Big Ben from the window so we enjoyed the view Laundry room was useful when you have a longer stay ,1
 Very close to London eye and across the bridge from Big Ben and Westminster abbey A small supermarket nearby and Starbucks Close to Waterloo station,1
 Great room with large size flat screen TV that had you tube videos and TV Excellent staff and consierge service Would come back here again to stay ,1
 Superb location starting with London Eye and Westminster Abbey Big Ben and some more within short walking distance Public transportation and train stops also very close Ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist Though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation I guess Staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting Magda on reception our cleaning lady Nadia and one member I think Sarah at the breakfast ,1
 Staff were friendly and very helpful Very impressed that we were afforded an upgrade which was appreciated as we had booked months in advance Buffet breakfast more than adequate and restaurant foyer in evening provided seating and food for guests wanting a smaller meal also staying in hotel Conceirage secured baggage during the day of departure while we were out ,1
 Location good value restaurant excellent staff ,1
 The location is fantastic for exploring the south bank and walking along the river The room was on the 13th floor so had amazing views of the London Eye Comfortable bed overlooking the views of London ,1
 Nice breakfast Good kitchen staff,1
 Room size was good and quiet and always cleaned,1
 Perfect location near Westminster Bridge Waterloo Mainline and tube stations and 5 minutes to South bank promenade and the London Eye Close to all sights and facilities We stayed for 8 nights in a large king sized suite with a separate large living room with view of the Shard Also had small kitchen with fridge and microwave Clean comfortable and great for an extended stay Great staff super helpful and has the bonus of a guest laundry with washers and dryers On site restaurant bars and great nearby bistros and restaurants ,1
 Overall hotel was centrally located and close to tourist attractions staff were courteous and helpful With information and very welcoming,1
 The view of the London Eye was amazing especially at night The bed was so comfortable with a puffy duvet and quality linens Breakfast included had a huge buffet with custom omelets ,1
 Excellent staff who are wonderful with children light spacious rooms with good facilities Excellent central location easy walking distance of many sights two tube stations river boats and tourist buses multiple eating options Westminster Southbank and London Eye all nearby From reservations and reception to housekeeping and room service the staff couldn t have been more helpful or accommodating This is a really good hotel and great for family visits Ours was a special family visit with grandparents parents and four grandchildren two children visiting for the first time and as a birthday treat The reservation and reception teams thanks to Courtney Michaela and I think Sara apologies for any incorrect spelling helped organise rooms with a wonderful view and facilities which made the visit very special for the grandchildren and grown ups The children also enjoyed the glass lift Reception staff were absolutely wonderful Alba was so welcoming and made an instant friend when she gave our grandson a lollipop on arrival and arranged birthday balloons and chocolate cake in the room Being able to arrange breakfast in the room made for a more relaxed start to the day and room service and housekeeping were so efficient and responsive managing to get our breakfast to us when we wanted it even when we forgot to put down the time for one of the rooms making the quietest meal delivery for the babysitters when the children were asleep and restoring order to our chaotic rooms while we were out This is the second time we have stayed at Park Plaza County Hall and given the high quality of the rooms and the excellent customer service we intend to return ,1
 Loved the view and the space,1
 The bed was very comfortable and was offered an upgrade with an awesome view of the London Eye with an early check in,1
 Rooms were great with lots of space to put clothes away and good cupboard in bathroom Good coffee facilities and fridge to put own drink ,1
 Staff were great and went the extra mile,1
 Staff in the bar at lunchtime were lovely and the food was very good,1

 Travelling to London was stressful as I had never driven into London before however it was not as difficult as I had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of 45 however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport The hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience I would recommend the last floor 14th the views were fantastic from the balcony The staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a 10 minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive I can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good The sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip The london Eye Parliarment Big Ben London Dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses All in all I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone ,1

 We arrived at 8 30am and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in London Great Although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however NOT sure they should have charged us extra given the view I think if you are going to charge an extra 30 pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view But we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from US ,1

 I was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly More specifically Brad Brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right Without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization He claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than 7 nights I told him I was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written He said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies I told him I disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments I asked to speak to his manager he said I am the manager Then I asked to speak to his superior Then he said I will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount I told him this will not work as it will take at least 5 days to reverse the payment He said that he is sure it will take few hours Unfortunately he cancelled it and took 5 working days During this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted Of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank I was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me Horrible customer experience ,1
 Location was great,1

 Our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff We got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice This was our first time in Paris and we loved it Farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had Would definitely recommend it ,1
 We had an amazing stay The rooms are very cozy with an amazing view of The Arc de Triumph I felt like home my entire stay Staff was nice all the time Would definitely stay again at this amazing little hotel ,1

 Could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in Paris In terms of location it doesn t get any better than this If you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all Arc De Triomphe We did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around Despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately The rooms are large by European standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view Friendly and courteous staff added to our stay A special mention of Mr Farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas Thank you Splendid Etoile you truly made our stay Splendid ,1

 The location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help The breakfast had more items than I expected For example I don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea To my surprise they had both regular yogurt and Greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises Also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the Eiffel Tower That was a totally unexpected treat Although I also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small It could barely fit 1 person I don t know how the bellman got our 2 suitcases and 2 rolling carryons into it I imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor 4th ,1
 Location was just excellent Staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for Paris really Very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting Paris again ,1
 Fantastic hotel near the Sorbonne on the Paris left bank Close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone Our room was a decent size and very comfortable The hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated Our room faced the street but at night it was quiet There are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff ,1
 The environment around is great A V lib station is in front of the hotel It takes about 30 minutes to go to Cath drale Norte Dame de Paris by walking There are some Asian style restaurants around the corner for people miss Udon with hot soups ,1
 Nice room very quiet in the night the bed was comfortable we particularily liked the bath tub and the small refrigerator The breakfast buffet was good The cold juice and water offered free of charge in the early afternoon was nice My daughter especially liked the PC and the candies in the reception area ,1

 Very good location safe and quiet in Latin Quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and RER directly to the airport And late afternoon I can always have a recess at the bueatiful Luxembourg park around the corner Plenty of nice and affordable local and Asian restaurants I like especially Au P re Louis and Sushiyaki I stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day This area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service My room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day I saw sunset on Effel tower and it was amazing ,1

 The rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use 2 rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either ,1

 Old hotel was grand once no doubt Reminded me of genteel poverty Our room looked onto back of other buildings and dumpsters which were unloaded early in the morning Very small rooms Busy street on other side of the square with shops lots of tourist tat chemists and eateries ,1
 Staff was friendly the hotel was clean and the breakfast really good ,1
 The breakfast was fantastic and the staff were brilliant They were really friendly and always keen to help Very close to Queensway tube and on the doorstep to Hyde Park ,1

 The staff and Management were top class and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them The breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food The rooms were smallish but the service compensated for that Thumbs up for this hotel Good location just off Bayswater Road close to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations ,1
 room clean and smart ,1
 I asked for a quiet room and I only heard one siren but the outlook over the dumpsters wasn t spectacular It was a surprise to receive half a bottle of wine don t like Merlot so my friend enjoyed it but the thought was nice ,1
 Breakfast was excellent,1
 I had to wait at reception for check in for 20 minutes and I was annoyed the kind Italian gentlemen at the reception added FREE breakfast for me and kept trying to crack jokes until I had a smile and accepted the apology The free breakfast was very good and I would definitely of paid for it Variety of things to have I checked out but my meeting was at 4pm they let me wait at the lovely waiting room downstairs until I was ready to leave The staff definitely cared about their customer being happy Thank You I d definitely come again,1
 The only positive is the location of this hotel ,1

 The staff was really friendly and they upgraded us to a coach room ,1
 the rooms were not in good shape The 1st room was so small we could just about get 2 suitcases into the room and then there was no floor space for an ironing board We requested a change The next room was better though in a semi basement but the toilet was so small and the wash basin smaller about 14inchX 14inches the tap looked enormous since the basin could not have been any smaller the pictures of the rooms should be made accurate ,1
 Awesome location very close to Queensway Tube and Bayswater tube shops restaurants convenience stores Hyde Park Bus Stop Excellent reception and staff Although my room was small which is normal by central London standards it was extremely well appointed Had everything one would need Breakfast was excellent too good spread freshly prepared ,1

 Staff very friendly and helpful hotel rooms and lobby spotlessly clean Rooms are small but perfectly formed with all mod cons ,1
 A really good location close to Hyde Park and Central London Staff were polite attentive extremely friendly and helpful We will definitely stay here again when visiting London Good value ,1
 The location of the hotel as we were visiting Hyde Park The history ambience of the original Edwardian house hotel although not all confirmed Would love to be a fly on wall back in the day Some very beautiful ornate decor on the ground and upper ground floor We wondered about the history as part of write up states you can very much feel the presence of Lillie Langtry especially in the Theatre Bar where she allegedly put on shows A very interesting property ,1
 Friendly staff,1
 Staff was wonderful Location was perfect ,1
 The front desk staff was phenomenal Super courteous wonderfully helpful finding directions arranging transportation giving information The bell hops were so professional too We didn t have to lug another suitcase once we arrived at the hotel Felt very safe and well taken care of except for the horrible pull out bed mattress ,1
 The manager of the restaurant was excellent had eyes everywhere The room was small but it was a single room and for central London I was very happy with it really The bathroom was lovely Easy walk to Paddington Station Comfortable hotel ,1
 The location and price was great Rooms in London are generally small so make sure you pay attention to which size room you pick If you book the smallest square footage room you will probably be disappointed with the size Don t pre pay breakfast during check in for the first morning if you might be jet lagged It ends at 10 AM and you probably will oversleep ,1
 The hotel was in a great location,1
 Service for breakfast was excellent Manuela especially Staff was very responsive and that is becoming rare ,1
 The hotel was very old fashioned which you don t see alot these days it was designed nicely,1
 the bed was comfy the breakfast had a wide range to suite peoples taste The location could not have been better with bayswater tube station and queensway within easy walking distance Most of all the staff were so kind and friendly nothing was to much trouble for them ,1

 Good Air conditioning and Comfortable bed ,1
 It was reasonably good lovely old building Albeit the superior room is there standard room so a confusing play with words So it was a squeeze to walk around the bed We didn t have breakfast there at London hotel prices ,1
 The breakfast buffet was excellent staff attentive The staff overall were friendly and helpful ,1
 To be honest I was disgusted with the hotel My friend was too big for bed ad he s 6 1 and the bathroom was a joke Tempted to ask for my money back ,1
 We were upgraded to another hotel as grand Royale was having plumbing problems We were given transport and breakfast for each day of our stay ,1
 The hotel was in great location next to Hyde Park Excellent reception lounge and bar area full of character and even a claim to have been bought for Lily Langtree to perform for her King Immaculately clean Room very comfortable and modern albeit rather small Breakfast was included and was very good served in a beautiful dining room ,1
 Extremely friendly staff very comfortable facilities many amenities in a very desirable area of London Excellent breakfast,1

 Loved the afternoon tea Every afternoon a staff would come bring chocolate to the room the Underground was right across the street staff was nice and helpful with suggestions and I slept on a cot because there were 3 of us in a room and the cot was actually very comfy ,1
 I travelled with my wife On arrival we were not given the room that we had booked First night was not very comfortable but the management were very apologetic and very helpful thereafter ,1
 Location is very good near 2 tube stops however rooms are super small Tiny in fact and I was a single traveller in a normal room and have no idea how 2 people could fit ,1
 On this occasion I had a decent sized quiet room on the top floor The public rooms are very atmospheric with dark panelling stained glass and comfortable chairs ,1
 Price per square meter foot has been in top three of places I have stayed Room was 1 8m by 2 9m plus bathroom of the 1 2x1 8 Total surface 8M ,1
 Great breakfast good staff especially Razavan at reception Magnificant Edwaridian common rooms and loby ,1

 Location was good and room was clean and comfortable Staff polite and welcoming ,1
 The location was wonderful Near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites The public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website That s why I picked this hotel In my price range ALL the hotel rooms in London were extremely small but the Grand Royale London Hyde Park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest The rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious ,1
 The hotel was conveniently close to Hyde Park where we liked to walk It was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services A convenience store was close by The hotel is a lovely old London town house style and the reception hall and public areas I would describe as Baronial The staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly Our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable ,1

 As it was my girlfriend s 30th birthday the reception staff very kindly gave us a free room upgrade to a shoebox sized room I can only assume our original room was the size of a matchbox A plus point was the free to use smart phone in the room although we didn t use it for fear of the cost involved if it was lost broken stolen while we were out and about ,1
 We stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel We loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom We were 3 adults and one toddler in this suite Breakfast was great as well and the location right next to Hyde park and Kensington gardens is perfect for kids Mommies can go shopping on the Westbourne grove ,1

 We had a wonderful stay Location is perfect The room was comfortable The staff was very kind and competent at any time The breakfast was really good and service was perfect ,1
 Just by chance I hit upon a hotel with a history It appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story The lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows The breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern Apparently Edward 7th bought this house for his mistress Lilly Langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate The hotel is in an excellent position being near Queensway Tube Station on the Bayswater Road and right opposite Kensington Gardens and about 6 minutes walk from the Palace It took me 45 minutes to walk through the Gardens and across Hyde Park passing the Serpentine and Rotten Row to reach Marble Arch ,1
 even though there was a minor inconvenience on our arrival the staff went above and beyond in trying to accommodate us Compliments to all staff they were courteous always willing to help with a smile on their faces And Alston at the front desk deserves a thumbs up for his professional treatment and kindness I will recommend this hotel to family and friends I felt like I was in old London which was very special Thanks to all the staff ,1
 The bedroom size and bathroom did not reflect the website In our opinion it was misrepresented Beautiful building and foyer small rooms and bathroom,1
 The staff were friendly and helpful The location s amazing so near Bayswater station and central to everything around the area Very strategic Also amazing decor in the hotel itself ,1

 Timeless elegance to this lovely hotel The staff made you feel special and on hand to help This was a very special treat for us and it was the right choice of hotel ,1
 The room we were given looked better than your pictures Staff were amazingly helpful and when we left I felt as though good friends were saying good bye to us Very personalised service Superb breakfasts,1
 The service was absolutely exceptional and they were so welcoming and constant attention to your every need was worth a return trip for sure Exceptional staff and willing to go overboard to make sure you feel like it is your home away from home They were kind enough to store our luggage for a side trip outside of london that we took prepare flowers for an event we attended and clean an outfit that another restaurant spilled on The bar staff especially Jacamo and Angelo were not only a delight but truly made our stay with their personalities and care It was nice to return to them after a day of site seeing or event attending Always upbeat staff The structure itself and decor was so well done and enjoyed the colors and style very much So english and beautiful Nice detail touches the ribbons on the table in the dining room and all the flowers were so well done A romantic and picturesque hotel worth staying at Air conditioner was great ,1
 Friendliness of staff who went above and beyond to make the hotel feel like home ,1
 The staff at the Milestone is what makes this place great I ve never stayed in a hotel with such friendly and helpful staff The hotel is small boutique yet the facilities are great it was pretty amazing to see how much they could fit into this place The location is also ideal just a short walk to the park across the street and close to shopping restaurants and the underground ,1
 Possibly the best overall hotel experience especially in UK that we hav experienced in recent years Staff exceptional and apart from one or two genuinely engaged with guests Congratulations to management n staff ,1
 I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights This is definitely an exceptional hotel The staff is amazing no other words to describe their hospitality Outstanding room Indulging bathroom and amenities Location is beautiful nearby Kensington Palace and Kensington Park Definitely I ll come again,1

 Very nice hotel and during our staying we enjoy seating in restaurant was our order afternoon tea and thanks for all staff who service us during our stay in hotel ,1
 The hotel was just fabulous in every respect but it was the staff who really made it different from other similar starred properties in London I was given a mini tour on arrival and a potted history of the building before being shown to my small but beautifully decorated room and given a welcome drink The area was so quiet and the bed extremely comfortable I opted for the healthy option at breakfast which was delicious and everyone I met made me feel extremely special I only stayed for one night but received lots of little gifts in that time I would certainly stay again Yes it was an expensive treat but makes a special occasion extra special and worth every penny ,1
 Afternoon tea was lovely The service was impressive and we really adored Fran who gave us a tour of the hotel and was most helpful in meeting all our needs From the bell hop to the concierge this hotel had the best service we ve ever experienced and we frequently travel via 5 star establishments We will return many times I m sure ,1
 The staff was amazing meeting all of our needs and more Locating a sitter for my boys providing games water for our walks and scooters in the park They were fabulous The location is perfect right across from Kensington Gardens ,1
 The staff were very good especially the doorman who helped us consistently the decor was very plush although we were left with no toilet paper one day after the room was serviced ,1
 Everything was outstanding got upgraded asked for extra day and stayed in my upgraded room for price of smaller one awesome staff warm room fantastic breakfast and service want to go back now ,1
 The friendliness of all the staff without being overpowering nothing was too much trouble The bedroom was immaculate with a very comfortable queen size bed The two evening meals we had in the restaurant were superb ,1
 Every thing was absolutely amazing An experience that I will never ever forget I enjoyed every single second and I will make sure that I book at this hotel next time I visit London ,1
 Very classic hotel with very nice location Staff there are all friendly and professional ,1
 Bed service and staff all excellent Got some fantastic few extras in the suite with it being our honeymoon ,1
 The personalities of the staff shone the warmest of welcomes and each interaction professional and yet interested in our day Such lovely people ,1
 Absolutely everything was perfect A very classy hotel with a super range of experiences didn t really want to bother with the rest of London it was so good ,1
 Level of service is excellent Great location,1
 Service levels are excellent This is a small boutique hotel so the rooms are on the small side but the level of service provided by the staff is incomparable I just love this hotel ,1
 Location excellent decor staff excellent however we were in room 105 so small and difficult to even move around disappointing I would think for the price to to expensive for such a small room,1
 Professional staff Clean Better than the last 5 star Meridian hotel which at stayed at in Vienna In Meridian Vienna some one entered our room and opened the safe and took pounds dollars and Kuwaiti dinars few from each on three different days a total of 3000 dollars were stolen ,1
 I would highly recommend this hotel From the moment we arrived to the minute we left the staff at the hotel were more than attentive and made our stay very welcoming The hotel surpassed our expectations,1

 All else was greatThere was a problem in the dining room at dinner on a Sunday night There was no decaffeinated coffee and there seemed nothing could be done about it as the machine they used only took one kind of coffee The machine in other area only made large quantities I had invited a friend for dinner I discussed with DR manager and he deducted an amount from our bill but it seemed totally ridiculous clearly the PM had not done the job he she should The breakfast Guests on Monday would have an issue too,1

 The room was clean and well presented the water was only warm in the shower not hot And there was a queue at breakfast which I m not sure why ,1
 The hotel is in major renovations with drilling starting as early as 8 AM The bar and rest if you could call them that are a disgrace No carpet on the stairs its cold and absolutely filthy The rooms are a disgrace Dirty bathroom floors stained linen on the bed as for the noise you may as well forget about sleeping due to drilling One lift worked for the two days which stopped at every floor regardless of requests hence it took 15 minutes to get to your room You know a hotel with 100 s of rooms with one lift and no access to stairs is beyond frustrating Id also think illegal in regards to safety If a fire started you d have no way out And when you mention the problems to front of house they smile and shrug Seriously what type of reply is that Lastly I ve stayed in most brand hotels in London due to the fact I fly there bi weekly as a rule I book direct if you re going to take a percentage of bookings you should at least offer hotels that function as such Will i use you again Doubtful Will I stay at that the holiday in Nope Never As it stands that hotel should not be suggesting its full service considering its a a work site pretending to be a full service hotel Regards Kieran,1
